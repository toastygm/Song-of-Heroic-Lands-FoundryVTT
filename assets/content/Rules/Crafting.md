**Crafting** is the making of a thing — a blade, a pot, a bow, a lock, a coat. Every trade that produces an article follows the same short routine, and the trades differ only in the detail they hang on it.

1. The crafter works in a [[#workshop|workshop]], rated one to five stars.
2. They spend the article's [[#craft-expense|expense]]: materials in money, labour in time.
3. They make one [[#craft-test|Success Value test]] of the trade's skill.
4. They read it on the [[#craft-result|result ladder]] — flawed, sound, or masterwork.
5. A masterwork result buys [[#masterwork|masterwork rolls]] or [[#fast-crafting|faster work]], as the crafter chooses.

What each trade adds to that frame is only ever the particulars: which skill is tested, how its cost and time are reckoned, what a flaw costs in that trade's own units, and how much fine work the material will take. Everything else is on these pages, and applies to every craft **whether or not that trade's own entry repeats it**.

Crafting is also how an article is put right again once it has been damaged; see [[#craft-repair|Repair]].

# The Workshop {#workshop}

A **workshop** is the place, the tooling and the stock a trade needs in order to work at all — a forge and its hammers, a kiln, a loom, a bench of files and picks. Every workshop is rated from **one to five stars** by how well it is found.

The rating does one thing: it sets the **Target Number** for [[#masterwork|masterwork rolls]]. A well-appointed shop does not make ordinary work come out better, and a poor one does not spoil it; what the shop decides is how far above ordinary the work can reach.

| Workshop  | Stars | TN  |
| --------- | ----- | --- |
| Makeshift | 1     | 1   |
| Sparse    | 2     | 2   |
| Standard  | 3     | 3   |
| Plentiful | 4     | 4   |
| Ideal     | 5     | 5   |

A trade may require a workshop of its own kind — a lock is not made at a tannery — and says so in its own entry.

# Expense {#craft-expense}

Before any test is made, the article's expense is spent. **Materials** are reckoned in money and **labour** in time, and a crafter puts in up to **ten hours a day**. Work measured in months is measured in the same working days.

Trades state that expense in one of two ways, and each says which it uses:

- **Per article.** A table gives the cost and the hours for each thing the trade makes — a dagger, a horseshoe, a saddle.
- **By price.** Cost and time are derived from what the finished article sells for, at a rate the trade gives — so many hours or days per so much of the sale price, at so much a day in materials.

**Cast work takes a quarter longer.** Where an article is founded rather than worked — melted, poured into a mould and then finished — add a quarter to the time the trade gives. Bronze, brass and pewter are cast; copper, silver, gold and iron are raised, drawn and hammered. This applies to every craft, whether or not the trade's own entry mentions it, and a trade that already prices its cast and wrought articles separately says so.

The expense is what the work costs when it goes normally. A [[#craft-result|Critical Failure]] adds to the time, [[#fast-crafting|fast crafting]] takes some of it away, and casting adds to it as above.

# The Test {#craft-test}

The whole of the work is settled by a single [[doc-sccssvlt#success-value-test|Success Value test]] of the trade's skill, made once the expense has been spent.

Each trade names the test it takes, and names it in the ordinary way: a **Weaponcraft (Metalcraft, Mineralogy)** test is a Weaponcraft Success Value test carrying Metalcraft and Mineralogy as [[doc-scndryms#secondary-modifier|Secondary Modifiers]]. Where what is being made decides the skill rather than the trade — a wooden haft against an iron head, a padded coat against a mail one — the trade's entry gives a table of which test applies to what.

Up to **two others may assist**, provided they are present for the whole of the work.

# The Result {#craft-result}

The Success Value is read on the ladder below. It is the crafting reading of the [[doc-sccssvlt#success-value|standard Success Value scale]], and every trade uses it unless it says otherwise.

| SV  | Outcome                                                                                                                                                       |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ≤ 2 | **Flawed.** The article is finished, but short of the catalogue: it loses quality, and whatever second measure the trade keeps alongside it.                  |
| 3–4 | **Sound.** The base article, exactly as catalogued.                                                                                                           |
| 5+  | **Masterwork.** Each [[doc-sccssvlt#value-diamonds\|Value Diamond]] buys either one [[#masterwork\|masterwork roll]] or [[#fast-crafting\|10% off the time]]. |

**A flaw costs what the trade says it costs.** How much quality is lost, what else goes with it, and how fast the loss grows as the Success Value falls further below 3 are all particular to the trade, and are stated in its entry.

**A Critical Failure is a setback, not a ruin.** On a Critical Failure on the test's underlying Success Test, crafting time **increases by half**. A few trades are harsher than that, and say so.

# Masterwork {#masterwork}

A Success Value of 5 or better yields [[doc-sccssvlt#value-diamonds|Value Diamonds]] — one for each point past 4, to a maximum of five. Each diamond is spent, one way or the other: on a masterwork roll here, or on [[#fast-crafting|fast crafting]]. The crafter chooses for each diamond separately, and may split them between the two.

Each diamond committed to fine work rolls **one d10 against a Target Number equal to the [[#workshop|workshop's]] star rating**, each rolled separately. Every success is a **Masterwork Success (MWS)**, and the total decides what the article became.

| MWS | Result                  | Value |
| --- | ----------------------- | ----- |
| 0   | Base article            | ×1    |
| 1   | Quality +1              | ×2    |
| 2   | Quality +1, modifier +1 | ×3    |
| 3   | Quality +2, modifier +1 | ×4    |
| 4   | Quality +2, modifier +2 | ×5    |
| 5   | Quality +3, modifier +2 | ×6    |

**Quality** is the article's own quality rating. The **modifier** is the second measure the trade keeps beside it — a weapon's impact, a bow's range, a suit of armour's Armour Value — and each trade says what its modifier does. **Value** multiplies what the finished article is worth.

**Not every success can be applied.** However many are rolled, an article will only take so much fine work: a plain material or a modest design caps what the crafter can put into it, and the surplus is simply pride. Each trade states its own cap.

# Fast Crafting {#fast-crafting}

A [[doc-sccssvlt#value-diamonds|Value Diamond]] need not be spent on [[#masterwork|masterwork]]. It may instead be spent to cut the **time** the work takes by **10%**, to a maximum reduction of **30%** — so at most three diamonds can be spent this way, however many the test produced. Any others may still be rolled for masterwork.

Fast crafting is available to **every** craft, whether or not that trade's own entry mentions it. Only time is bought: the materials cost what they cost, and the article is otherwise exactly what the result ladder says it is.

# Repair {#craft-repair}

An article that has lost quality can have it put back. The test is a Success Value test of the same skill that would have made the article.

**In the field**, an article reduced by **only one** point of quality can be repaired without a workshop: the test is made **without Secondary Modifiers** and takes **10% of the article's listed crafting time**, at no cost in materials. **A Success Value of 1 or better restores the lost point.** Field repair therefore almost always works, and is limited by the hours it takes rather than by the roll.

**In a workshop**, the same test is made at **+2 SV**, and the quality restored is worked out through the [[#masterwork|masterwork]] steps above — never exceeding the article's undamaged rating.
