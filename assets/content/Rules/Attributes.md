An **attribute** is an innate capacity a character is born with and develops only slowly — the raw material a skill is built on. Where a skill measures training at a particular activity, an attribute measures the underlying faculty that training draws upon.

Attributes matter chiefly through [[doc-mstrylvl#skill-base|Skill Base]]: a skill's starting [[doc-mstrylvl#mastery-level|Mastery Level]] is derived from the attributes that skill depends on, so a character's innate capacities shape what they can readily learn. They are also tested directly when a situation calls on raw capacity rather than trained technique.
