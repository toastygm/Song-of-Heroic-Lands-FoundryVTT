A new injury is **untreated**, and healing cannot begin until it is treated. An untreated wound is resolved as though its treatment roll were a **Critical Failure**.

Each wound has a **required treatment** — the specific action that must be taken:

| Code    | Treatment                                                                         |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CLN** | Clean and dress the injury with water and bandages.                               |
| **CMP** | Apply a cool, wet dressing to ease discomfort.                                    |
| **SET** | Splint a simple fracture.                                                         |
| **SUR** | Complex surgery (requires surgical tools). An MF or CF roll causes a **bleeder**. |

Treatment is a **Physician** test with the treatment's difficulty modifier. Its result sets the injury's Healing Rate:

**Treatment table** — resulting Healing Rate by roll and severity:

| Roll    | Minor | Serious | Grievous |
| ------- | ----- | ------- | -------- |
| CF (−1) | HR 4  | HR 3    | HR 2     |
| MF (0)  | HR 5  | HR 4    | HR 3     |
| MS (1)  | HR 6  | HR 5    | HR 4     |
| CS (2)  | HEAL  | HR 6    | HR 5     |

A result of **HEAL** heals the wound immediately.

**Treatment actions** — the required action and its difficulty modifier by aspect and severity (_action_ / _modifier_):

| Aspect   | Minor     | Serious   | Grievous  |
| -------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Blunt    | CMP / +30 | SET / +10 | SUR / 0   |
| Edged    | CLN / +20 | CLN / +10 | SUR / 0   |
| Piercing | CLN / +10 | CLN / 0   | SUR / −10 |
| Fire     | CMP / +20 | CLN / +10 | CLN / 0   |

### Special Injury Effects

Certain wounds carry an additional effect:

- **Possible permanent impairment** — Serious HR 3–4 or Grievous HR 2–4 blunt wounds; Grievous HR 2–4 edged wounds; Serious HR 3 or Grievous HR 2–4 piercing wounds; Grievous HR 1–3 fire wounds.
- **Bleeder** — Grievous HR 2 or HR 3 blunt, edged, or point wounds.
