Injuries recover through periodic **Injury Healing Tests**, one per injury on that injury's own healing period. Each is a test of **`Healing Base × Healing Rate`** (see [[doc-hlngbs|Healing Base]]), read by [[doc-sccsstst#success-level|success level]]:

| Success Level | Result                                                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CF (−1)       | No healing. If infection was possible, an [[doc-infctn\|Infection]] occurs. |
| MF (0)        | No healing.                                                                 |
| MS (1)        | Reduce Injury Level by 1.                                                   |
| CS (2)        | Reduce Injury Level by 2.                                                   |

As injury levels decrease, severity lessens at certain thresholds—see [[doc-injrylvl|Injury Levels]].

**An untreated wound automatically Critically Fails every healing test.** A wound that has never been treated has no Healing Rate, and so nothing to test against: no dice are rolled, and the test resolves as a **Critical Failure** — mechanically, a rolled **00**, which fails every target and ends in a critical digit. Such a wound therefore makes no progress however long it is left, and takes the Critical Failure consequences each period: being an untreated wound exposed to infection, it contracts an [[doc-infctn|Infection]].

This governs **healing tests only**. The Physician's [[doc-trtnginj|Treatment Test]] is _not_ a healing test — it is rolled against the Physician's own skill, and it is what establishes the Healing Rate that later healing tests use. (An untreated wound is separately resolved as though _its treatment roll_ were a Critical Failure, which is the rule that leaves it exposed to infection.)

**An active infection halts healing.** While the patient carries _any_ active [[doc-infctn|Infection]], **no** Injury Healing Tests are made for them until every infection has been defeated.

## Arcane Recovery

An immediate Healing Test or the single highest test bonus from an arcane healing source may be applied instead of (not in addition to) the normal periodic Healing Test.
