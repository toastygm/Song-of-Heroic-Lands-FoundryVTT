Some injuries can become **infected**. When such an injury's [[doc-hlngtst|Injury Healing Test]] comes up a [[doc-sccsstst#success-level|Critical Failure]], a new infection takes hold. An infection starts with a **Healing Rate one step higher than the injury it came from** (originating injury HR + 1).

## Weakness

An infection saps the body, inflicting [[doc-fatigue|weakness fatigue]] according to its current Healing Rate:

| Healing Rate | Weakness Fatigue |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| HR 1–2       | 10               |
| HR 3–4       | 5                |
| HR 5+        | None             |

## Recording an infection

An infection is treated as a physical injury, recorded **separately** from the wound it came from, with:

- **Aspect** — "Inf".
- **Injury Level** — "X" (not applicable).

**An active infection halts injury healing.** While the patient carries any active infection, **no** [[doc-hlngtst|Injury Healing Tests]] are made for them until every infection has been defeated.

## Infection Healing Test

An infection heals through the **Infection Healing Test** — a test of **`Healing Base × Infection Healing Rate`** (see [[doc-hlngbs|Healing Base]]). The result changes the infection's Healing Rate:

| Success Level | Change to Infection HR |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| CF (−1)       | −2                     |
| MF (0)        | −1                     |
| MS (1)        | +1                     |
| CS (2)        | +2                     |

When the infection's Healing Rate rises to **6 or greater**, the infection is **healed**, and normal [[doc-hlngtst|injury healing]] can resume.
