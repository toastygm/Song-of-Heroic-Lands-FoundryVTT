# The package landing at /sohl/ — the entry point to everything this repository
# publishes (#1466), and the address the site's navigation, the shipped system's
# in-app help, and every external link to the project use.
#
# What this page is *not* is as load-bearing as what it is. It is not the site's
# front page, which already carries Knowledgebase and API cards — repeating those
# here would make this a second copy of that grid. It is not the project page at
# /projects/song-of-heroic-lands/, which pitches the system to someone deciding
# whether to try it. This page serves the reader who has already arrived: it
# tells them how to install it, and routes them by what they came to do. So the
# shape is deliberate — install first, because it is the one thing no other page
# gives concretely, then three doors chosen by audience rather than by which
# surface happens to publish them. A reader at the table should not have to know
# that the rules live on the knowledgebase and the API reference does not.
#
# Everything below `landing:` is the shared contract documented in
# @heroiclands/hugo-theme's README under "A package landing page" and rendered by
# its `layouts/partials/landing.html` (theme #33, #1760). Six packages emit it,
# so nothing here is this repository's own shape and this page ships no CSS.
#
# Every `url:` is relative to the package root, which the theme resolves against
# this site — so the whole landing follows the /sohl/ mount rather than restating
# it link by link.

  HârnMaster-compatible, and built to keep the books while you make the calls.

  lead: >-
    Everything published for the system lives under this address: the rules and
    the player guides, the full catalog of content it ships, and the generated
    reference for building on it. SoHL tracks the wounds, the healing, the
    calendar and the modifiers, then asks you what you want to do — nothing
    happens to a character without their player's say-so, and every number on
    the sheet shows where it came from.

  install:
    heading: Install it in Foundry
    intro: >-
      In Foundry's setup screen, choose **Game Systems > Install System** and
      paste this manifest URL:
    url: https://github.com/HeroicLands/Song-of-Heroic-Lands-FoundryVTT/releases/latest/download/system.json
    note: >-
      Requires Foundry VTT v14. The system is in active development, so expect
      change between releases — see the [latest
      release](https://github.com/HeroicLands/Song-of-Heroic-Lands-FoundryVTT/releases/latest)
      for what is in this one, or [open an
      issue](https://github.com/HeroicLands/Song-of-Heroic-Lands-FoundryVTT/issues)
      if something is wrong.
