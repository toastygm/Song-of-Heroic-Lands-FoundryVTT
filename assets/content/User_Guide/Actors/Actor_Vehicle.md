# What Is a Vehicle?

A Vehicle is a **conveyance that carries people** — a wagon, a ship, a boat, a cart. It is the thing the party travels _on_, and the thing their cargo travels _in_.

**Its unique capability is its occupants.** A Vehicle is the only actor other than a [[doc-beingug|Being]] that carries a property of its own, and that property is the list of who is aboard: each occupant named, with a role — **crew**, **passenger**, or **draft creature** — and an optional style such as _Bosun_ or _Helmsman_. An entry may name a single character or a whole [[doc-cohortug|Cohort]], which is shorthand for all of that cohort's members riding along.

That is the question a Vehicle exists to answer: **who is on board, and in what capacity.** Everything else it does — holding cargo, carrying actions, taking effects — any actor can do.

Like every actor, a Vehicle carries movement rates for the mediums it can travel in, so a river barge and a mountain wagon can be given different speeds.

# When to Use a Vehicle

Use a Vehicle when:

- The party travels by ship, wagon, cart, or boat, and it matters who is aboard
- You want the crew and the passengers distinguished, and a captain named
- Cargo and stores should live with the conveyance rather than in someone's pack
- The conveyance has a travel speed of its own

For a fixed place that does not move — a building, a wall, a bridge — use a [[doc-structureug|Structure]] instead.

# What a Vehicle Contains

- **Occupants** — who is aboard, each with a role and an optional title.
- **Gear** — cargo, equipment, and stores carried on the vehicle.
- **Movement** — its travel rates, per medium.
- **Actions** — procedures you attach to the vehicle.
- **Effects** — active effects on the vehicle.

# What a Vehicle Does Not Model

A Vehicle is a container and a conveyance, not a creature:

- **No capacity.** There is no cargo limit and no passenger limit. Nothing weighs the load or refuses to accept more; how much a wagon can really take is yours to judge.
- **No condition of its own.** A Vehicle has no structural integrity, no hit points, and no damage model. It cannot be worn down, holed, or wrecked by the rules — a ship that catches fire is a matter for narration.
- **No crew effects.** Having a helmsman aboard, or losing one, changes nothing mechanically. The roles are there to record who is doing what, not to modify anything.

# The Vehicle Sheet

The Vehicle sheet has these tabs:

- **Facade** — image and description
- **Profile** — movement rates, the private dossier, and attributes
- **Gear** — cargo, equipment, and stores
- **Actions** — available actions
- **Effects** — active effects

All five are the common actor tabs, and they behave exactly as they do on a [[doc-beingug|Being]]: the Gear tab is the same inventory ledger (a vehicle's cargo instead of a character's possessions), and the Actions and Effects tabs are identical. They are documented once, in [[doc-undrstndsheetug|Understanding Sheets]] under _Common Actor Tabs_ — see that page for the columns, controls, and how to add, stow, and remove things.

The **Profile** tab carries three things, and it is where a vehicle's private notes live:

- **Attributes** — normally empty for a vehicle. The section is kept so a world that wants to give a ship a Quality a rating of its own can.
- **Movement** — the travel rate for each medium, with a star marking the active one.
- **Biography** — the **dossier**, the private description only you and the GM see. The public description a player sees stays on **Facade**.

The one difference: a Being's Gear tab reports carried weight and encumbrance, because a character is slowed by what it carries. A vehicle is not encumbered by its cargo, so its Gear tab reports the cargo's total weight alone.

# Intrinsic Actions

A Vehicle defines no actions of its own. It carries only the actions every actor shares:

| Action              | Shortcode           |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Edit                | `editDocument`      |
| Delete              | `deleteDocument`    |
| Make Default Medium | `makeDefaultMedium` |

All three belong to every actor and are described on [[doc-baseitemug|Base Item]], which covers what each one does, how it is invoked, and what it produces — the shared document actions are the same wherever they appear.

**Make Default Medium** picks which movement medium a vehicle is currently moving in, and it is driven by the star control in the movement table on the vehicle's own **Profile** tab — click the star beside a medium to make it the active one. **Add Movement Profile**, in that table's header, adds a rate for a medium the vehicle does not yet have.

The cargo and equipment a vehicle carries are ordinary gear items with actions of their own — see [[doc-gearug|Gear]] and the page for each kind of gear.
