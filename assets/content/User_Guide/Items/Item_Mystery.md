# What Is a Mystery?

A Mystery represents a supernatural condition or aspect of the Being. It represents what the Being "is" rather than what they can "do". Fate points, piety, blessings, and other similar conditions are all mysteries.

# Where It Appears

Mysteries appear on the Being sheet's **Mysteries** tab.

# Additional Properties

Along with the [[doc-baseitemug|Standard Item Properties]], the following properties also appear in the **Properties** tab:

- **SubType:**
- **Level:** Power level of this mystery, if applicable
- **Charges:** If this mystery can be used up, this represents the number of charges
  - **Current Charges:** Charges remaining. Leave it blank for a mystery whose uses are unlimited (the sheet shows ∞).
  - **Maximum Charges:** The cap, and the control that decides whether the mystery uses charges at all. Leave it blank for one that does not (the sheet shows :icon-not-applicable:); enter `0` for one that is counted but uncapped.

# Intrinsic Actions

A Mystery describes what a character _is_, not something they roll, so it defines no action of its own. It carries only the standard actions every item has:

| Action                     | Shortcode           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Edit                       | `editDocument`      |
| Delete                     | `deleteDocument`    |
| Output Description to Chat | `outputDescription` |

All three belong to every item and are described on [[doc-baseitemug|Base Item]], which covers what each one does, how it is invoked, and what it produces.

A Mystery's effect on a character is applied through the Active Effects it carries, and any power a character actively invokes is a [[doc-mysticalabilityug|Mystical Ability]], which has its own action and roll.
