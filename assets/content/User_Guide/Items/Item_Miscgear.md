# What Is Miscellaneous Gear?

Miscellaneous Gear is the catch-all category for general equipment that does not fall into the specialized categories of weapons, armor, containers, projectiles, or concoctions. This includes tools, clothing, rope, torches, food, trade goods, coins, and any other items a character might carry. If an item is not a weapon, armor, container, ammo, or consumable potion, it is Misc Gear.

# Where It Appears

Misc Gear appears on the Being sheet's **Gear** tab and can optionally be nested inside a Container Gear item to reflect where the character is carrying it. Misc Gear items are commonly added from compendium packs or created manually to represent ad-hoc possessions.

# Additional Properties

There are no additional properties beyond the [[doc-gearug|Standard Gear Properties]].

# Intrinsic Actions

Miscellaneous Gear defines no actions of its own. Everything you can run against a piece of it is a standard action it already inherits:

| Action                     | Shortcode           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Edit                       | `editDocument`      |
| Delete                     | `deleteDocument`    |
| Output Description to Chat | `outputDescription` |
| Toggle Carried             | `toggleCarried`     |

The first three belong to every item and are described on [[doc-baseitemug|Base Item]]; **Toggle Carried** belongs to every piece of gear and is described on [[doc-gearug|Gear]]. Those pages cover what each one does, how it is invoked, and what it produces — none of it changes for Miscellaneous Gear.
