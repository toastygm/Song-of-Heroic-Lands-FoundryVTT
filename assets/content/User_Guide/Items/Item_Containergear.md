# What Is a Container?

Containers represent an object that holds other items — a backpack, sack, chest, belt pouch, saddlebag, or any other storage vessel. Containers use SoHL's nested item system to hold other gear items inside them, helping organize a character's inventory and track what is stored where. This matters for encumbrance, accessibility during combat, and narrative details like "the potion is in my belt pouch."

# Where It Appears

Containers appear on the Being's **Gear** tab. Other gear (Miscellaneous, Concoctions, Projectiles, Armor, Weapons, even other Containers) can be nested inside a Container, creating a hierarchical inventory structure.

# Additional Properties

In addition to the [[doc-gearug|Standard Gear Properties]], the following additional properties are defined for containers:

- **Capacity** — how much the container can hold, limiting what can be stored inside.
- **Weight** — the weight of the container itself (contents add their own weight on top).
- **Contained Items** — the gear items nested inside this container.

<!-- TODO: Expand with details on how container capacity is enforced,
     how nested containers affect encumbrance calculations, and
     accessing items from containers during combat -->

# Intrinsic Actions

A container defines no actions of its own. Everything you can run against one is a standard action it already inherits:

| Action                     | Shortcode           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Edit                       | `editDocument`      |
| Delete                     | `deleteDocument`    |
| Output Description to Chat | `outputDescription` |
| Toggle Carried             | `toggleCarried`     |

The first three belong to every item and are described on [[doc-baseitemug|Base Item]]; **Toggle Carried** belongs to every piece of gear and is described on [[doc-gearug|Gear]]. Those pages cover what each one does, how it is invoked, and what it produces — none of it changes for a container. Everything else about a container — its capacity, and what is nested inside it — is set on the sheet or by dragging gear onto the container, not by running an action.
