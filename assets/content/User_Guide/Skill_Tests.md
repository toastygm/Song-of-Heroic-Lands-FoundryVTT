# Overview {#tests-overview}

Most actions in SoHL are resolved through **skill tests** — rolling dice against a target number derived from a character's skill mastery level. When two characters compete, the system uses **opposed tests** to determine the winner.

# Performing a Skill Test {#tests-performing}

1. Open the character's sheet and go to the **Skills** tab.
2. Click the name of the skill you want to test.
3. A **Success Test Dialog** appears showing:
   - The skill's effective mastery level (EML)
   - Any situational modifiers
   - Options for the test
4. Adjust modifiers if needed and click **OK**.
5. The result appears in the chat window.

## Understanding Results

A skill test rolls against the effective mastery level. The result is one of:

- **Critical Success (CS)** — an exceptional success (roll of 5 or divisor of EML)
- **Marginal Success (MS)** — a success by a narrow margin
- **Marginal Failure (MF)** — a failure by a narrow margin
- **Critical Failure (CF)** — a significant failure (roll of 96+)

The exact thresholds depend on the effective mastery level.

# Effective Mastery Level {#tests-eml}

The **effective mastery level (EML)** is the target number for a skill test. It starts from the skill's base mastery level and is modified by:

- **Situational modifiers** — bonuses or penalties from the environment, equipment, or conditions
- **Injury penalties** — wounds reduce skill effectiveness
- **Fatigue** — exhaustion penalties
- **Equipment bonuses** — some gear provides skill bonuses

The EML is shown in the Success Test Dialog before you roll.

<!-- TODO: Document how modifiers stack, the modifier audit trail
     (ValueModifier system), and how players can view what's affecting
     their EML -->

# Success Value Tests {#tests-sv}

Some tasks represent sustained effort — crafting an item, sailing a passage, researching a question — where rolling dozens of individual tests would be tedious and swingy. A **Success Value Test** resolves the whole task with one roll, producing a graded outcome instead of a simple pass or fail.

Run one from a skill the same way you run a Success Test: click the skill's **Success Value Test** action. The system makes an ordinary success test, then reads the result on a graded scale. The chat card shows:

- **Success Value** — the graded number, derived from the skill's Index (its mastery level ÷ 10) plus a modifier for how well the roll went.
- **Value Diamonds** — how far the work exceeds an ordinary result, from zero up to five diamonds.
- **Result** — the plain-language meaning of that Success Value (no value, little value, base value, or a bonus value carrying diamonds).

The card also shows the underlying roll and target, so you can see how the grade was reached. See the [[doc-sccssvlt|Success Value Tests]] rules for the full scale.

# Editing a Test Result (GM) {#tests-gm-edit}

Every posted test result card carries a small **edit pencil** in its header. This is a **GM-only** tool — players do not see it — and it is the GM's higher-fidelity counterpart to a player spending [[doc-thftsystug|Fate]]: it lets you correct or adjust a result you have already rolled **without re-rolling the dice**.

To edit a result:

1. On the test result card in chat, click the **edit pencil** in the card header.
2. The **Success Test Dialog** reopens, pre-filled with that result's current **Situational Modifier** and **Success Level Modifier**.
3. Change either value — for example, apply a circumstance you forgot, or nudge the outcome up or down.
4. Click **OK**. The test is **re-evaluated against the same die roll** and the card updates in place with the new outcome.

Clicking **OK** without changing anything leaves the result untouched.

How the edit is applied:

- **The die is never re-rolled.** The original d100 is kept; only the target and the outcome are recomputed.
- **Changing the Situational Modifier** changes the effective target, so the success level is re-derived from the same roll (a larger penalty can turn a success into a failure, and vice versa).
- **Changing the Success Level Modifier** shifts the outcome up or down a fixed number of steps (for example, Marginal Success > Critical Success) without touching the target.

Unlike Fate, a GM edit costs nothing and can move a result in either direction. Use it to apply a ruling, fix a mistaken modifier, or reflect a circumstance that came to light after the roll.

# Opposed Tests {#tests-opposed}

When two characters compete directly, the system uses an opposed test:

1. The initiating character performs a skill test.
2. The opposing character performs a counter-test.
3. The system compares the results to determine the winner.

Opposed tests are used for:

- **Combat** — attack vs. defense
- **Social contests** — persuasion vs. resistance
- **Stealth** — hiding vs. perception
- Any situation where two characters directly compete

<!-- TODO: Document the opposed test resolution mechanics — how ties are
     broken, how critical results interact, and how the margin of success
     is calculated -->

# Skill Base and Attributes {#tests-skillbase}

Every skill has a **skill base formula** that determines its starting value from the character's attributes. For example, the Sword skill might have a base formula of `sb(attr.str, attr.dex)` — meaning it averages Strength and Dexterity.

The skill base is calculated automatically when attributes are set. The mastery level builds on top of the skill base through training and experience.

See [[doc-skillug|Skills]] for more about how skill bases work.

<!-- TODO: Document how skill improvement works — SDR (Skill Development
     Roll), experience-based advancement, and the relationship between
     mastery level base and effective mastery level -->
