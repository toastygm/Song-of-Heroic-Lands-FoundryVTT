A grab is the opening of a wrestle rather than a blow, and the grabber declares which of two things they are attempting before any roll is made:

**Take** an object held by the target in the zone struck — a left or right arm — pulling a weapon out of the hand that holds it. The hit _location_ within that zone is irrelevant; it is the limb you have hold of that matters. Disarming a swordsman ends a fight about as reliably as wounding him, and rather more cheaply.

**Hold** that zone immobile for a round, which is how you pin the arm holding the knife while somebody else deals with it.

Winning the Melee test only earns the attempt. Both combatants then make an opposed **Strength Trial** (`d6 + STR`), at +3 per Impact Tactical Advantage, −2 if you have only one hand on them and −3 off-handed. The manoeuvre happens only if the grabber wins the Trial as well; otherwise the grab simply fails and nothing at all occurs.

**A hold that lands** forces the target to Pass on their next turn, though they may still defend if able. On the grabber's next turn the Strength Trial repeats: win and the hold continues, lose and it is broken. Holding a stronger opponent is therefore a losing game played one round at a time.

Only one Strength Trial is made per opposed Melee test, and only a combatant who _initiates_ one and wins it may inflict the special effect. A counterstriking manoeuvre therefore cancels the attacker's — whoever won the Melee test gets the Trial.
