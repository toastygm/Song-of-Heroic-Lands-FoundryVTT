A hooked ankle, a swept shin, a leg behind the knee. Like the press it does no harm of itself; what it does is put an opponent on the ground, and a prone fighter is a fighter at everyone's mercy — slow to rise, penalised while down, and unable to run.

Winning the Melee test earns an opposed **Strength Trial** (`d6 + STR`), at +4 per Impact Tactical Advantage — the most generous bonus of the three manoeuvres, so a tripper who is thoroughly winning the exchange rarely fails. If the tripper wins the Trial as well, the margin decides what happens:

| Margin | Effect on the opponent                                                                   |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–4    | Knocked prone.                                                                           |
| 5–9    | Thrown five feet and knocked prone.                                                      |
| 10+    | Thrown five feet and knocked prone, and the tripper may succeed automatically on a Grab. |

Otherwise there is no effect.

Only one Strength Trial is made per opposed Melee test, and only a combatant who _initiates_ one and wins it may inflict the special effect. A counterstriking manoeuvre therefore cancels the attacker's — whoever won the Melee test gets the Trial.
