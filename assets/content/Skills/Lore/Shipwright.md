Shipwright is the building of ships and boats and much of what goes on them, sails included. Construction divides into two traditions, and they are not interchangeable:

**Carvel** planking is laid edge to edge, giving a smoother and stronger hull that can be built large, at the cost of weight and of a heavier internal frame.

**Clinker** planking overlaps, giving a lighter and far more flexible hull — fast, forgiving in a seaway, and limited in the size it can reach before the method defeats itself.

Which tradition a shipwright learned depends entirely on where they were raised, and their Mastery Level is keyed to that home region. Building in the foreign style reduces Mastery Level by **40**. In the border regions where both are practised, a shipwright must still commit to one, but the foreign penalty is only **20**. A handful of great shipyards work both, and those are the places where new designs come from.

**Construction** is measured in worker-months of 24 days. A shipyard typically carries about five workers per point of the settlement's Market Size, which is why serious hulls only come out of serious ports.

| Vessel            | Length | W-m | Cost | Vessel           | Length | W-m | Cost |
| ----------------- | ------ | --- | ---- | ---------------- | ------ | --- | ---- |
| Cog               | 48′    | 110 | £68  | Coastal longboat | 36′    | 45  | £27  |
| Great galley      | 60′    | 200 | £120 | Ship's boat      | 15′    | 5   | £3   |
| Longship          | 54′    | 100 | £60  | Coaster          | 48′    | 80  | £48  |
| Merchant galley   | 60′    | 125 | £75  | Fishing smack    | 24′    | 15  | £10  |
| Great merchantman | 90′    | 340 | £203 | Ocean knarr      | 60′    | 150 | £90  |

Building a vessel is a **Shipwright (Woodworking)** Success Value test, using the master's Shipwright Mastery Level and a Secondary Modifier from the averaged Woodworking of the yard. The result multiplies the base time and cost:

| SV  | Time | Cost |
| --- | ---- | ---- |
| ≤ 4 | ×1.3 | ×1.2 |
| 5   | ×1.2 | ×1.1 |
| 6   | ×1.1 | ×1.0 |
| 7   | ×1.0 | ×1.0 |
| 8   | ×0.9 | ×1.0 |
| 9+  | ×0.8 | ×0.9 |
