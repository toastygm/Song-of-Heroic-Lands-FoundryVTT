Brewing is the making of alcoholic drink, and what it produces varies enormously in how far it will travel. Hops are not in general use as a preservative, so ale is drunk within a few days of being made and is therefore a strictly local product. Wine keeps, travels, and is traded at distance; the better vintages are chased. Distilling is a recent and uncommon art, and spirits are usually laid down for a further three to six months after they are made.

A Brewing Success Value test measures a **five-gallon batch** on the standard table. **Time** is the labour that goes in; **days** is how long the batch will keep before it must be drunk.

| Beverage | Cost | Time | Days      | Price |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | --------- | ----- |
| Ale      | 2d   | 20h  | 2d2       | 8d    |
| Mead     | 10d  | 10h  | 24 + 6d6  | 15d   |
| Spirits  | 92d  | 20h  | 4 + 2d2   | 120d  |
| Wine     | 18d  | 30h  | 76 + 4d10 | 20d   |

**Wine** alone rewards a fine hand at the price. Roll a number of d10 equal to the Value Diamonds of the test against the workshop's Target Number, and add **5d to the price for each success** — a distinction the brewer of ale never gets to collect on, because their product will be gone before anyone can argue about it.

Brewing is one of the trades that develops a nose. A brewer notices odours that others walk past, and a character distracted or unfocused tests their best olfactory skill to register a smell at all.
