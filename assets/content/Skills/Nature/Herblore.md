Herblore is the knowledge of plants and of how to preserve and prepare them. In settled realms an apothecaries' guild regulates the keeping, compounding and sale of herbs; apothecaries sometimes gather their own, but usually buy wholesale from unguilded foragers — hunters, trappers, cottagers. Outside that arrangement, tribal and rural herbalists do both halves of the work themselves.

**Foraging.** Gathering in the wild is resolved as part of overland travel. The forager declares what they are looking for and, on success, comes back with a number of doses. Each dose has a **potency** — the rarity of the plant, the quality of what was actually found, and plain luck:

| d10 | Potency |
| --- | ------- |
| 1–6 | Mild    |
| 7–9 | Strong  |
| 10  | Great   |

The GM may instead make a single roll to set the potency of a whole gathering of the same herb.

**Mundane concoctions** use herbs as ingredients in another craft's recipes — brewing, cookery, embalming, perfumery. The game does not track species for these; a dose is simply "brewing herbs" or "cookery herbs" and behaves accordingly.

An apothecary preserves and stores herbs in a dry, dark workshop with a Herblore Success Value test. A dose then loses one level of potency every **30 + (SV × 10) days**. When such herbs are sold on to a crafter, the herbalist's Herblore Mastery Level serves as a **Secondary Modifier to the buyer's own Success Value test** — the proxy case, where one character's competence lifts another's work — and a Strong dose grants a further **+1 SV**, a Great dose **+2 SV**.

**Exotic concoctions** are potions: herbs prepared to produce a specific effect. Foragers seek them by category rather than by species, since each general category is some particular local plant.

**Time** — about ten minutes' preparation, which may be heating, boiling or grinding to a paste. No workshop is needed; a potion can be made in the field. Up to **half the herbalist's Herblore Index** doses of the same herb and potency may be prepared together.

**Test** — a Herblore Success Value test.

**Result** — the effect depends on the potion type and the herb's potency, and is almost always stated as a bonus or penalty equal to the Success Value, doubled for a Strong herb and quadrupled for a Great one.

**Duration** — once prepared but not yet used, a potion keeps for **d6 + the maker's Herblore Index** days. An unpreserved foraged herb, meanwhile, loses a potency level every **2d6 days**, and is useless for potions once it falls below Mild.

**Application** — most are ingested, some smoked; some are poultices applied as part of a treatment. A paste adhered to a blade or broadhead takes effect only when that weapon's edge or point actually causes an injury worse than a glancing blow.

**Prices**, per dose, according to potency:

| Potency | Wholesale | Retail as ingredient  | As a potion |
| ------- | --------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| Mild    | 1d        | 4d — or (1d8)d        | 16d         |
| Strong  | 3d        | 12d — or (3d8)d       | 48d         |
| Great   | 30d       | 120d — or (3d8 × 10)d | 480d        |

Wholesale is what a forager charges a herbalist; where the herbalist gathered it themselves, there is no such cost. Retail is what a herbalist charges a professional buying ingredients. The potion price is what a customer pays, and randomises as four times the ingredient dice.

Herblore is one of the trades that develops a nose, and a character distracted or unfocused tests their best olfactory skill to register a smell at all.
