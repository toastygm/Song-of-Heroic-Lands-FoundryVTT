Fishing is the taking of fish and other water creatures by whatever means the water rewards — hook and line, spear, net, weir, or bare hands. Culture, geography and quarry decide which technique is favoured; the skill covers competence in all of them.

A Fishing Success Value test is made **once per four hours**, modified for technique and water. What it yields is **food-days**: a day's fish weighs about six pounds, of which half is edible.

| SV  | Catch                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ≤ 0 | Nothing at all over the four hours.                                                                                                                                                |
| 1–2 | Roll two d10 separately against the conditions Target Number; each success is one food-day.                                                                                        |
| 3–4 | As above, but roll four d10.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5+  | One food-day per Value Diamond, plus four separate d10 against the conditions TN, each success adding a further food-day. If all four of those d10 succeed, double the whole take. |

A Critical Failure means trouble with the gear or the water: the fisher tests Dexterity if the units digit was 0, Agility if it was 5. Failure costs lost or damaged equipment; a Critical Failure means a random impact injury.

**Conditions.** The GM rolls or chooses the water's Target Number. Reduce it further where too many people are working the same water — several lines in one small stream compete with each other.

| d100  | Conditions | TN  |
| ----- | ---------- | --- |
| 01–05 | Poor       | 1   |
| 06–25 | Fair       | 3   |
| 26–75 | Average    | 5   |
| 76–95 | Good       | 7   |
| 96–00 | Excellent  | 9   |

**Technique.** Fishing **bare-handed** is a Fishing (Dexterity) Success Value test at **−2 SV**, and is really only practical in shallow streams and coastal shallows. A **net** doubles the food-days taken. A **spear** makes it a Fishing (Melee or Dexterity) test.

**Water.** The base test assumes fresh water. In **salt water**, a Critical Success adds **two** to the Success Value rather than the usual one. **Offshore** — the deeper, richer water beyond inland lakes, rivers and shallow coast — doubles the food-days taken, cumulatively with everything else.
