Jewelcraft is gem-cutting, goldsmithing and silversmithing, and the fine metalwork that surrounds both — a ring, an amulet, a torc, a brooch, a chain, and more rarely a diadem or a small figure. Cut stones are traded on their own account as well as set into work.

# Crafting {#crafting}

A piece is made by the common [[doc-crafting|crafting routine]] — workshop, expense, test, result, masterwork rolls, repair. What follows is what is particular to the jeweller's bench.

**Expense.** A finished piece usually weighs around **2d6 ounces**, up to triple that for something substantial and half for a ring or a pair of earrings. The work runs **a day to the ounce** and never less than a day, so a typical piece is a week or so at the bench.

**Test.** A Jewelcraft Success Value test, read on the standard ladder, fixes the quality of the piece.

**Price.** A finished piece is worth its metal and the work in it, rounded to the penny. The **metal** is the weight of the base form times the price per ounce of its material. The **work** is **6d for every day at the bench**, reckoned as above — a day to the ounce, and never less than a day, so a ring is a day's work whatever it weighs. The metal is the jeweller's own outlay; the rest is his time. Bronze, brass and pewter are founded rather than raised, so a piece in them takes the [[doc-crafting#craft-expense|quarter longer that cast work takes]].

Without the second term a piece of base metal would be worth almost nothing, since the work in a copper chain is the same work as in a silver one. Most pieces are also set with **1d6** cut stones, each adding the **square of its weight in carats** times the stone's listed value. An eight-carat pearl is therefore worth 640d, which is why weight matters so much more than count.
