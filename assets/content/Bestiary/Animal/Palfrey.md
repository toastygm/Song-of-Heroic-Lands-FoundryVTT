# Appearance {#appearance}

The horse approaches with a measured, almost gliding stride, its motion so smooth it seems the rider barely rocks in the saddle. Dappled sunlight plays across its well-groomed coat, rich chestnut or gray depending on bloodline, rippling with each effortless step. Its head carries high, ears alert but relaxed, dark eyes showing intelligence and calm acceptance. There is nothing hurried or aggressive in its bearing — only a quiet competence that speaks of miles and hours of reliable travel.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The palfrey is a refined riding horse selectively bred by nobility for comfort and endurance across long distances, typically standing 14-15 hands tall and weighing 800-1000 pounds. These mounts are not creatures of war or speed racing but rather the preferred conveyance of ladies, couriers, and wealthy merchants who value steady progress over dramatic performance. A traveling party might own a palfrey or hire one along established trade routes, making it a commonplace sight in civilized lands.

## Presentation

Palfreys display refined proportions with long, graceful necks, sloping shoulders, and legs built for stamina rather than explosive power. Their coats typically display clear solid colors — chestnut, gray, bay, or black — usually well-maintained and often marked with heraldic trappings, fancy saddles, and decorative tack. The face is alert but kind-natured, with large, intelligent eyes and ears that respond to subtle commands. Compared to warhorses, palfreys appear lighter and more elegant, lacking the massive musculature and commanding presence of military mounts.

## Key Behaviors

Palfreys are temperamentally calm and responsive to their riders, having been selected for generations for obedience and steady nerves. They focus entirely on the task of traveling, maintaining a consistent, distance-eating gait through varied terrain. These horses are social creatures that travel well in groups but form strong bonds with individual riders and handlers. They are primarily diurnal, preferring to travel during daylight hours and settle during dusk. Their diet consists of grass, grain, and hay, and they require regular water and rest. Without an experienced handler, palfreys become anxious and may refuse to travel.

## Combat Strategy

A palfrey has no combat training and will attempt to flee from violence whenever possible. If startled or cornered, it becomes unpredictable, rearing and bucking in panic rather than engaging with calculated strategy. Without a skilled rider providing direction and confidence, the palfrey's instinct is to run. If trapped or blocked from escape and directly attacked, it will use its hooves defensively, striking at immediate threats, but combat is antithetical to its nature. Wise riders recognizing danger will dismount and lead the palfrey away rather than attempting to fight mounted.

## Attack Methods

### Hoof Strike

Cornered or panicked, the palfrey rears slightly and lashes out with a foreleg strike, using its weight and muscle to injure something nearby. These strikes are desperate defensive reactions rather than tactical combat moves.

### Rear and Buck

A palfrey surprised by violence often rears up on hind legs and then kicks backward with both hind legs in a panic response. This can unseat an unprepared rider and cause injury to threats approaching from behind, though the horse is purely reacting to fear rather than fighting with intent.

## Special Abilities

### Endurance Gait

The palfrey moves with a distinctive, smooth four-beat gait that minimizes rider fatigue and allows steady progress across long distances. It can maintain a controlled pace for hours without tiring, making it the mount of choice for journeys spanning days or weeks. The horse's natural rhythm and comfortable motion make travel less exhausting for the rider.

### Steady Temperament

Palfreys are bred for emotional stability and will not spook at common sights, sounds, or situations. They remain calm in crowded markets, on uncertain footing, and during weather changes. This reliability makes them trustworthy on difficult terrain where panic would be dangerous.

### Additional Information

Palfreys have little resale value after injury or significant training loss — nobles will abandon an injured palfrey rather than attempt recovery. Their calm nature makes them unsuitable for theft; they will not move willingly with an unfamiliar handler. A palfrey's shoes must be regularly reset and its hooves maintained, making them expensive to own and care for. In wilderness areas without established stables or farrier services, palfrey owners face serious logistical challenges.
