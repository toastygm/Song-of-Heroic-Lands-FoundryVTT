# Appearance {#appearance}

The sound begins before dawn — a noise so deep and so vast that your first instinct is geological, as though the mountain itself is groaning. It builds in waves, a rolling, resonant roar that seems to come from everywhere at once, filling the jungle canopy with vibration you can feel in your teeth and your sternum. Then another voice joins, and another, and the separate calls merge into a wall of sound that carries for miles through the humid air, drowning out every other forest voice. You look up and see them: dark shapes sitting in the upper canopy, bearded and heavy, mouths open wide, the sound pouring from throats that seem impossibly large for animals weighing less than twenty pounds. The howler monkey's call is the loudest sound produced by any land animal, and hearing it for the first time — feeling it roll through the forest like distant thunder made personal — you understand why the jungle peoples associate these creatures with the voice of the gods and the scribes of the underworld. The monkey nearest you pauses its calling and turns to regard you with calm, amber eyes. The face is dark and intelligent, framed by a thick beard and an expression of settled, philosophical disdain. It has been watching you since before you noticed it. It will be watching you long after you have passed.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Howler Monkey is the dominant primate of the tropical lowland and cloud forests — a large, heavily built canopy monkey famous for producing the loudest vocalization of any land animal. Weighing fifteen to twenty-two pounds with a body length of two feet plus a prehensile tail of equal length, the howler is a folivorous canopy-dweller that lives in troops of ten to twenty individuals. The howl — produced by a specialized hyoid bone in the throat that amplifies sound to extraordinary volume — carries for three miles or more through dense jungle and serves as a territorial declaration, a dawn census, and a means of spacing troops across the forest without physical confrontation. In the jungle civilizations, the howler monkey is associated with scribes, artists, and the arts of communication — the connection between the monkey's world-filling voice and the human power of language and writing. Howler monkey imagery appears in the decoration of libraries, scriptoria, and the workshops of artisan castes. The monkey god associated with writing and record-keeping is depicted with howler monkey features. Adventurers in the tropical jungles will hear howler monkeys long before seeing them — the dawn chorus is one of the defining sounds of the lowland forest, and its sudden absence is an ominous sign that something has disturbed the canopy.

## Presentation

The howler monkey is a stocky, powerfully built primate with a body designed for an arboreal, sedentary lifestyle. The fur is typically dark brown to black, dense and coarse, with a distinctive beard of longer hair framing the face in males. The face is bare, dark-skinned, and set with forward-facing eyes of amber or brown that convey an impression of weary intelligence. The most notable anatomical feature is invisible from the outside: the hyoid bone in the throat is enlarged into a hollow, resonating chamber that amplifies the monkey's calls to a volume that defies the animal's modest size. The jaw is correspondingly large and prominent, giving the face a heavy, projecting appearance. The body is compact and muscular, with short, strong limbs adapted for slow, deliberate movement through the canopy rather than the acrobatic leaping of smaller monkeys. The prehensile tail is the howler's fifth limb — strong enough to support the animal's full weight, sensitive enough to serve as a tactile probe, and used constantly for gripping branches, stabilizing posture, and freeing the hands for feeding.

## Key Behaviors

Howler monkeys are social, territorial, and conspicuously vocal. The dawn howling chorus begins before sunrise and can last for thirty minutes or more, as troops across the forest declare their positions and negotiate spacing without physical contact. This behavior is remarkably energy-efficient — by advertising their location vocally, troops avoid the caloric cost and injury risk of direct territorial confrontation. Howlers are primarily folivorous (leaf-eating), supplemented by fruits, flowers, and occasional insects. Their leaf-heavy diet provides relatively little energy, which explains their sedentary lifestyle — howler monkeys move less than any other primate of comparable size, spending much of the day resting and digesting. Troops are organized around a dominant male and several females, with younger males either subordinate within the troop or expelled to form bachelor groups. Howlers are not aggressive toward humans unless provoked, but they express displeasure by defecating and urinating on intruders from above — a behavior that is more effective and more unpleasant than it sounds.

## Combat Strategy

Howler monkeys avoid physical confrontation whenever possible. Their primary defense is the howl itself — the sheer volume and deep resonance of the call is disorienting at close range and serves as an effective deterrent. If physically threatened, a troop will retreat through the canopy, where their arboreal agility makes pursuit by ground-based predators impossible. A cornered howler will bite — the jaw is powerful and the canine teeth are long — and a troop defending young will mob a threat with biting, scratching, and the targeted dropping of branches and fecal matter.

## Attack Methods

### Canine Bite

The howler's enlarged jaw houses long, sharp canine teeth capable of inflicting deep puncture wounds. The bite is powerful for an animal of its size and is used primarily in intra-troop disputes and self-defense.

### Arboreal Bombardment

A troop of howlers will drop branches, fruit, and fecal matter on intruders below. While individually these projectiles are not dangerous, the combined effect of a dozen monkeys simultaneously targeting a single individual is disorienting, disgusting, and surprisingly effective at driving away threats.

## Special Abilities

### World's Loudest Voice

The howler monkey's call, amplified by the specialized hyoid bone, is the loudest sound produced by any land animal — audible at distances of three miles or more through dense forest. At close range (within a few dozen paces), the sound is physically disorienting, vibrating in the chest cavity and making concentration difficult. The dawn chorus of multiple troops calling simultaneously creates an auditory landscape that dominates the forest.

### Prehensile Tail

The howler's tail is a fully functional fifth limb — strong enough to support the animal's full body weight, dexterous enough to manipulate small objects, and sensitive enough to serve as a tactile probe in the dark canopy. This adaptation gives the howler a degree of arboreal security that makes it virtually impossible to dislodge from a tree.

### Silence Warning

The sudden cessation of howler monkey calling is one of the most reliable indicators of danger in the tropical jungle. Experienced forest travelers know that when the howlers go silent, something has entered the canopy that frightens even the loudest voice in the forest — typically a jaguar, a large raptor, or something worse.

## Attributes
