# Appearance {#appearance}

The smell reaches you first—a sharp, musky odor mixed with the reek of overturned soil and crushed berries. The creature emerges from the tree line with deceptive grace, its glossy black coat catching dappled sunlight. Its head swings toward you, and you see small, intelligent eyes set above a blunt muzzle. The forest floor trembles with each heavy-footed step, and when the bear rises onto its hind legs, muscles ripple beneath its dense fur. The sound it makes—a low, rumbling huffing—vibrates in your chest.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The black bear is a forest predator and scavenger of remarkable strength and surprising intelligence. Standing five to six feet tall on its hind legs and weighing four hundred to six hundred pounds, it is one of the most common large carnivores adventurers will encounter in temperate and boreal regions. Despite their fearsome reputation, black bears are opportunistic and typically avoid humans when they can. However, they are fiercely protective of food sources and offspring, making them dangerous when startled, hungry, or defending cubs. A bear that has learned humans carry food becomes increasingly bold and increasingly dangerous. Adventurers may encounter them in forests, near campsites, around berry-rich clearings, or at carrion sites.

## Presentation

A powerfully built mammal standing on short, sturdy legs. Its coat is thick and glossy, typically jet black but sometimes dark brown or cinnamon. The head is broad with rounded ears set midway back, and its face tapers to a shorter muzzle than most canines. Small, dark eyes convey surprising intelligence. Its paws are large, each equipped with five long, curved claws—formidable tools for climbing, digging, and combat. Despite its mass, the bear moves with a deceptive grace, capable of surprising speed in short bursts. The most distinctive feature is the character of the animal's scent, a complex musk that fills an entire area when the bear is agitated.

## Key Behaviors

Black bears are primarily solitary animals, though females with cubs are occasionally seen in small family groups. They are prolific foragers, capable of deriving sustenance from dozens of different food sources: berries, nuts, roots, insects, fish, small mammals, and carrion. This dietary flexibility allows them to thrive in diverse environments. They have exceptional memories and learn quickly—a bear that discovers a rich food source will return to it repeatedly, and a bear that has stolen food from humans will continue attempting to do so until the behavior is harshly punished. Black bears are stronger swimmers than brown bears and will spend considerable time in water during salmon runs or in hot weather. They build dens for winter hibernation, choosing protected cave sites or hollow trees, and enter a torpor state that lasts several months. Cubs remain with their mother for one to two years, learning essential survival skills, and mothers are extraordinarily protective during this period. Any perceived threat to cubs will trigger an immediate and savage response.

## Combat Strategy

A black bear's strategy depends on context. If cornered or defending food or cubs, it will attack with overwhelming ferocity, using its weight and strength to overpower and immobilize threats. Against multiple opponents, it may charge the closest one with intent to seize and crush, ignoring other attackers temporarily. It will rear onto its hind legs to maximize reach and striking power, then crash down in powerful swipes. Bears are also excellent climbers despite their mass—a wounded or threatened bear may retreat up a tree to escape threats or ambush from an elevated position. In forests, bears use terrain to their advantage, attacking from behind obstacles or using dense vegetation to conceal approach.

## Attack Methods

### Claw Swipe

The bear rises slightly and delivers a devastating horizontal slash with one foreleg, its claws raking across multiple targets or concentrating force on a single opponent. The force is sufficient to penetrate armor and cause severe lacerations. A bear skilled in combat (usually from repeated encounters with humans) will often lead with this attack, clearing space and assessing the opponent's defenses.

### Mauling Charge

The bear lowers its head and charges forward with full weight behind it, intending to knock the target down and maul it while it's prone. The impact alone can break bones, and once an opponent is on the ground, the bear uses its weight and claws to inflict maximum damage.

### Bite

When at close quarters, the bear snaps with powerful jaws, attempting to seize a limb, shoulder, or head. Its bite force is sufficient to crush bone and tear large amounts of meat. A bear that has subdued an opponent may bite and shake violently, multiplying the damage.

## Special Abilities

### Exceptional Strength and Resilience

Black bears possess powerful muscles and dense bone structure. They are capable of moving boulders weighing hundreds of pounds to access roots and insects beneath, and their physical resilience allows them to absorb impacts that would disable human-sized opponents. Blunt force trauma is notably less effective than cutting or piercing attacks.

### Keen Senses

A bear's sense of smell is legendary—it can detect food sources miles away on the wind and can distinguish scents that would be undetectable to humans. Its hearing is equally acute, capable of detecting the crackle of a campfire or the rustle of prey in undergrowth. Vision is the weakest sense, but it remains adequate for detecting movement and estimating distance.

### Climbing and Swimming

Despite their mass, black bears are surprisingly agile climbers. They can ascend trees to pursue prey, escape threats, or forage for nuts and insects. They are also strong swimmers and will pursue prey into water. A wounded bear may retreat into water to cool its body and clean wounds, then hunt from the shoreline or mid-stream.

### Thick Hide and Fat Layer

A bear's skin is tough and its body is insulated by a thick layer of subcutaneous fat that provides both thermal protection and trauma resistance. Slashing weapons are less effective than piercing attacks, and the fat layer provides some resistance to blood loss.
