# Appearance {#appearance}

The forest seems to bow before it—a creature standing over six feet at the shoulder, carrying antlers that span nearly ten feet, spreading like the branches of an ancient oak rendered in bone. The coat is rich brown, lightening to a soft tan on the belly, with a distinctive white patch blazing across the chest like a mark of distinction. The stag moves with fluid grace that belies its size, each step careful and deliberate, and the antlers—heavy as they must be—are carried with perfect balance. The eyes are dark and soulful, large enough to reflect your image, and they hold an intelligence that is unmistakable. When the stag raises its head and fixes its gaze on you, you feel not hunted but weighed, evaluated, and found to be of interest.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Great Stag is a regal megafauna creature that dominates the deeper forests and wild woodlands of temperate climates. These are herd animals, though they are led by a single dominant male whose strength and size set him apart from all others. A Great Stag in his prime is nearly unstoppable—a creature built for dominance through sheer physical power. These animals are generally peaceful grazers, but a stag defending his territory, his does, or his status will fight with absolute determination.

## Presentation

The Great Stag is an animal of clear majesty and power. Standing over six feet at the shoulder, the creature is built with the grace of a dancer and the power of a warrior. The antlers are the defining feature: a matched pair spanning nine to ten feet across, with multiple points and branches, each point capable of penetrating armor. The coat is rich brown with lighter underbelly, and a distinctive white patch marks the chest—a blaze of color that announces the stag's confidence and status. The head is large and noble, with large, intelligent eyes and ears positioned to catch sound from all directions. The body is muscular but refined, not bulky—the stag is built for speed as much as power.

## Key Behaviors

Great Stags are herd animals that roam in established herds, typically composed of does and their young, with the dominant stag maintaining exclusive breeding rights. During the rut (mating season), stags become territorial and aggressive, challenging rivals and defending harems. Outside breeding season, stags may form bachelor groups with other males of similar age or strength. They are primarily nocturnal or crepuscular feeders, spending daylight hours resting and chewing cud. They communicate through vocalizations (bugling and roaring) and through scent marking.

## Combat Strategy

A Great Stag uses its antlers as primary weapons, charging with the full weight of its body and using the antlers as lance points. If forced to fight at close range, the stag uses powerful legs to deliver crushing kicks from both hind legs (when rearing) and front legs (when striking). A stag defending its herd or territory fights with terrible determination and will not retreat until the threat is eliminated or escape is impossible. A stag facing overwhelming odds will attempt to scatter and flee, using forest terrain to break pursuit.

## Attack Methods

### Antler Charge

The stag drives forward with antlers lowered, using the combined force of the charge and the weight of the creature to impale and gore opponents. Each point of the antlers can penetrate armor.

### Hoofed Strike

Both front and hind legs deliver powerful kicks—the hind legs are used when the stag rears, the front legs during a collision. These strikes are capable of breaking bones and driving opponents backward with force.

## Special Abilities

### Herd Coordination

When the stag moves with a herd, the group shares alertness and protective behavior. A threat to one triggers response from all, and the herd can execute coordinated movements—stampedes or coordinated charges—that amplify the danger.

### Dominance Display

The Great Stag can perform displays of intimidation—rearing, bellowing, and thrashing antlers—designed to frighten opponents. A creature witnessing this display must resist fear or risk fleeing.

## Additional Information

A Great Stag's antlers are shed annually and can be collected for weapons, decorations, or trophies. The size and quality of antlers reflects the stag's health and status. A stag's hide is valuable for leather working. Some cultures consider the Great Stag sacred or hunt it as the ultimate test of a warrior's skill.
