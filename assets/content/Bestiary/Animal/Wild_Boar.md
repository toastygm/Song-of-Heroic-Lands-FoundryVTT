# Appearance {#appearance}

The dense, matted bristles catch the light as the creature stamps forward, revealing a musculature beneath the coat that belies the stocky frame. The tusks curve upward wickedly from the lower jaw, aged and stained, clearly weapons used repeatedly to gore earth and enemies alike. The elongated snout roots at the ground methodically, evidence of both foraging behavior and destructive power. The small eyes are bright with intelligence and aggression, and the growl that emerges speaks of relentless territoriality and absolute willingness to fight.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Wild Boar is a heavily muscled, stocky ungulate standing 2-3 feet at the shoulder and weighing 200-400 pounds, found in forests, scrublands, and rough terrain throughout temperate regions. These aggressive, territorial creatures are dangerous primarily during defensive moments, though mature males are aggressive year-round. Adventurers encounter them while traveling forests, hunting game, or inadvertently entering territory claimed by boars.

## Presentation

The wild boar is stocky and barrel-shaped with a dark bristly coat ranging from brown to black. Short, sturdy legs support the weight, and powerful tusks curve upward from the lower jaw. The snout is elongated and powerful, clearly adapted for rooting through soil. The body is heavily muscled beneath the bristly coat, and the hide is thick and tough.

## Key Behaviors

Wild boars are omnivorous and spend much time rooting through soil for roots, tubers, and grubs. They are solitary except during mating season, when males become intensely aggressive. They are active primarily during dawn, dusk, and night. They can move with surprising speed despite their build. Mothers defending young become nearly unstoppable in aggression.

## Combat Strategy

The wild boar charges directly at threats with unexpected speed, using tusks to gore and attempting to knock opponents off balance. It continues attacking with commitment despite injury. Boars defending young fight suicidally.

## Attack Methods

### Charging Goring Attack

The boar charges with full force, attempting to gore with tusks and knock opponents backward.

### Trampling

Once an opponent is knocked down, the boar may attempt to trample under its weight.

### Tusking and Slashing

If close combat is engaged, the boar uses upward tusking motions to create distance and inflict injury.

## Special Abilities

### Charging Momentum

The boar's charge is devastating in force and nearly unstoppable once committed.

### Tough Hide

The thick coat and tough skin provide protection against light slashing attacks.

### Relentless Will

Once engaged, boars fight with commitment despite damage, driven by territorial aggression.

### Additional Information

Wild boars are most dangerous during rutting season when males are aggressive year-round. Mothers defending young are nearly unbeatable and should be avoided. The creatures' tusks can be harvested after death for crafting or decoration. Boar hunting is traditional in many cultures and carries significant danger.
