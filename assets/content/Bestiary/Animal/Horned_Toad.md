# Appearance {#appearance}

The desert floor erupts with motion—a squat, armored shape surfacing from the sand like a spiky crown. Every inch of the creature bristles with sharp, bony protrusions that catch the sunlight. Its coloration blends so perfectly with the surrounding dunes that you almost missed it, and only the swift dart of its oversized eyes and the flick of a long, precise tongue give it away. The air carries a faint, metallic tang—old blood, perhaps. This is survival distilled into scales and spines.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Horned Toad is a four-foot-long reptile perfectly adapted to harsh desert and badlands environments. Its body is a armor plating of jagged, bony protrusions that extend from its crown, back, and tail, serving both as defensive armor and as a warning to would-be predators. Its sand-colored scales and warty, irregular texture allow it to vanish against rocky or sandy terrain. Its eyes are large and independently mobile, providing nearly 360-degree vision.

## Presentation

Horned toads are squat and heavily built, with short, powerful legs that allow them to move with surprising speed across desert terrain. Their heads are broad and flattened, crowned with a row of distinctive spikes and horns. The body tapers slightly toward a thick, muscular tail ringed with spines. The scales are dull and dusty in coloration—tan, brown, and gray with darker mottling—providing excellent camouflage. Their eyes are large, unblinking, and capable of swiveling to track movement in nearly any direction. A long, sticky tongue extends frequently, catching insects.

## Key Behaviors

Horned toads are primarily insectivorous, spending much of their day hunting small arthropods with their precise, rapid-fire tongue strikes. They are solitary and territorial, establishing home ranges that they patrol daily but remain in for extended periods. During extreme heat, they burrow into sand or hide beneath rocks to avoid dehydration and temperature extremes. They are most active during cooler mornings and evenings. When threatened, they exhibit a dramatic and effective defensive display: they can force blood to pool behind their eyes and spray it outward with surprising force and accuracy, creating a burst of crimson that startles and disorients predators.

## Combat Strategy

Horned toads strongly prefer to flee or hide when threatened, using their camouflage and low profile to escape notice. If cornered or trapped, they resort to their defensive arsenal: a display of spines and horns to appear larger and more formidable, a powerful tail swipe that can puncture or lacerate, and finally the blood spray if an attacker presses close. They are not aggressive combatants and typically will not pursue fleeing opponents.

## Attack Methods

### Tail Sweep

The horned toad lashes its thick, spined tail with surprising force, capable of knocking smaller foes off balance, inflicting puncture wounds, or driving back melee combatants.

### Blood Spray

If pressed into direct contact or threatened with grappling, the creature forces blood to the back of its eyes and expels it in a forceful burst up to 10 feet; this spray causes momentary blindness and disorients targets, and the blood itself is caustic to mucous membranes.

## Special Abilities

### Spiked Body

The array of bony protrusions covering the horned toad’s body inflicts damage on any opponent attempting to grapple, pin, or tackle it; these spikes are particularly effective against unarmed combat.

### Desert Camouflage

When still, the horned toad’s coloration and texture allow it to blend nearly perfectly with rocky or sandy terrain, making it nearly impossible to spot without careful observation or magical assistance.
