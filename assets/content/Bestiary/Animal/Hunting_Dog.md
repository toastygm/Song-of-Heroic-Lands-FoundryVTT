# Appearance {#appearance}

The dog's nostrils flare as it catches your scent on the wind, and its entire body goes tense with focus. Every muscle defines itself beneath sleek fur, and its eyes—bright and intelligent—lock onto you with predatory interest. The warm, animal smell of it carries on the breeze, mingled with the scent of leather and old sweat from the hunters it serves. A low, rumbling sound builds in its chest, not yet a snarl, but a promise of violence.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Hunting dogs are medium-sized, powerfully built canines bred and trained over generations to track, pursue, and bring down prey. They stand 24-28 inches at the shoulder and weigh 45-70 pounds, with lean, muscular builds designed for endurance over distance and speed in short bursts. Their intelligence is considerably higher than that of wild dogs, a result of selective breeding and training.

## Presentation

Hunting dogs display a variety of coat colors—red, black, brindle, or combinations thereof—depending on their breeding line. Their fur is short and dense, providing protection from brush and weather without impeding movement. They have deep chests, long legs with visible musculature, and tails that remain raised and alert. Their ears are medium-sized and alert, and their eyes are bright, intelligent, and constantly scanning. They move with an economical grace, each step purposeful. A well-trained hunting dog may wear a leather collar or harness and often bears scars from previous hunts.

## Key Behaviors

Hunting dogs are disciplined and focused, capable of tracking a scent over dozens of miles and across many hours. They respond to handler commands instantly and will maintain a hunt even when exhausted. They are highly social within their pack structure, following a clear hierarchy. When working, they communicate through subtle body postures, brief vocalizations, and scent marking. They rest between hunts, alert but patient, waiting for their handler's next instruction.

## Combat Strategy

Hunting dogs employ pack tactics when possible, surrounding prey and cutting off escape routes while one or more dogs close for the bite. A dog will target the extremities—legs, arms, throat—to immobilize or wound. They circle and harry opponents, wearing them down through relentless pressure and coordinated attacks. Against multiple opponents, they prioritize isolating weaker or separated targets.

## Attack Methods

### Bite

The hunting dog's powerful jaws clamp down on limbs, throats, or torsos, aiming to wound and immobilize; a dog that has latched on will shake violently to inflict additional damage.

### Coordinated Tackle

A hunting dog will leap at an opponent, driving them backward or to the ground with its full body weight; multiple dogs will execute this simultaneously to ensure success.

## Special Abilities

### Scent Tracking

The hunting dog can follow a scent trail over any surface and across extended distances, even days old; it can distinguish between individual scents and will unerringly pursue a marked target.

### Pack Coordination

Hunting dogs gain significant combat bonuses when working alongside other trained dogs, and they can execute complex coordinated attacks based on subtle handler signals or instinctive pack behavior.
