# Appearance {#appearance}

The dog rises before you fully register its presence, muscles rippling beneath short, dense fur. It is large—easily comparable in weight to a full-grown man—with the build of a creature bred for power and endurance. The eyes are intelligent and focused, fixing on you with absolute certainty of purpose. The growl is not threatening display but simple fact: this creature knows exactly what you are, has assessed you as potential threat, and has decided how it will respond. When the teeth show, they are functional and sharp. The ears are forward, tracking your slightest movement, and the entire body is coiled tension—ready to move in any direction at the instant the command arrives.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Guard Dogs are large canines bred and trained for protection work, combining the loyalty of domestic dogs with the aggression of predators. These are disciplined, intelligent creatures that follow commands from handlers and protect designated charges with unwavering dedication. A guard dog is worth several armed humanoids in defensive capability. Adventurers most commonly encounter them protecting settlements, guarding important persons, or defending valuable locations.

## Presentation

A mature guard dog stands roughly two feet at the shoulder and weighs between one hundred twenty and one hundred eighty pounds. The build is powerfully muscular, with broad shoulders and deep chest. The coat is typically short and dense, in colors ranging from black to brown to mottled. The head is large and powerful, with a broad muzzle and strong jaw. The eyes are intelligent, capable of reading human emotion with uncanny accuracy. The overall impression is of a creature simultaneously noble and dangerous.

## Key Behaviors

Guard dogs are intensely loyal to their handlers and obey commands absolutely, even unto death. They are territorial and aggressive toward perceived threats to their territory or charges. Unlike wild dogs, they are disciplined and do not attack without provocation or command. A well-trained guard dog responds to subtle hand signals and voice commands, moving with precision. They are most active during daylight hours but can work at night if trained.

## Combat Strategy

A guard dog fights with discipline and strategy, not wild aggression. If commanded to attack, the dog lunges with focused purpose, attempting to grapple and immobilize. If defending a charge, the dog positions itself between threat and protected individual. A guard dog fighting for its handler commits fully and shows remarkable reluctance to retreat.

## Attack Methods

### Powerful Bite

The dog's bite is designed to grip and hold—the dog bites a limb or torso and attempts to drag the target down or away from protected charge. The bite is painful and causes serious injury.

### Tackling Charge

The dog uses its weight to knock opponents down—running directly at threats and impacting at waist height or lower, driving targets backward or to the ground.

## Special Abilities

### Protective Loyalty

When defending its handler or designated charge, the guard dog gains significant bonuses to all combat actions. The dog will not retreat if its charge is threatened.

### Command Obedience

The dog responds instantly to voice commands and hand signals from its handler, executing complex maneuvers with precision. This coordination makes the dog-handler pair far more effective than individual components.
