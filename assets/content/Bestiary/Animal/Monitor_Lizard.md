# Appearance {#appearance}

The lizard’s tail is what catches your attention first—a muscular, whip-like appendage that sweeps across the ground with ominous purpose. The body following it is lean and powerful, covered in scales that range from yellow-brown to dark gray depending on how the light hits them. Its head is small but purposeful, with a jaw line that suggests strength, and when it flicks its forked tongue in and out, the motion seems to taste your very fear. Its claws click against stone as it moves with fluid grace. The eyes—small, bright, and utterly focused—never leave you as it approaches.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Monitor lizards are large, agile reptiles measuring 5-7 feet in length and weighing 15-35 pounds, depending on species. Their bodies are covered in rough, scaly hides colored in patterns of yellow, brown, and gray that provide good camouflage in arid or rocky environments. The build is lean but muscular, with powerful musculature concentrated in the neck, shoulders, and tail. The head is proportionally small and tapered, with a strong jaw and small eyes positioned forward.

## Presentation

Monitor lizards display rough, knobbed scales across their entire body, particularly along the spine and tail. The coloration is typically cryptic—browns, grays, and yellows with darker banding or mottling—allowing them to blend with rocky or sandy terrain. The tail comprises nearly half the total body length and is muscular, whip-like, and used for balance, swimming, and combat. The head is triangular when viewed from above, with a powerful jaw line and small, dark eyes. The claws on all four feet are sharp and partially curved, designed for climbing. The tongue is long and forked, used for smelling and tasting the air.

## Key Behaviors

Monitor lizards are opportunistic hunters, equally comfortable hunting terrestrial prey, climbing to raid bird nests, or diving in water after aquatic prey. They are primarily solitary but may gather at carcasses or rich feeding grounds. They are excellent climbers, swimmers, and runners, using speed and agility to capture prey. They have relatively good eyesight and rely on it heavily in hunting. They are active during the day and retreat to burrows or crevices at night or during extreme heat.

## Combat Strategy

Monitor lizards prefer to use speed and agility to advantage, striking from unexpected angles or retreating before a stronger opponent can mount an effective counterattack. They bite and claw at the head and neck of prey to disable it quickly. If facing a larger or more formidable opponent, they rely on hit-and-run tactics, biting and escaping to higher ground. Their tail is used as a secondary weapon to create distance and inflict slashing damage on pursuers.

## Attack Methods

### Powerful Bite

The monitor lizard lunges to clamp its jaws on the target’s head, limb, or body, delivering puncture damage and tearing; the bite can sever fingers or toes and can cause serious bleeding.

### Tail Lash

The lizard sweeps its whip-like tail to strike opponents at distance or to defend itself from threats; the tail strike can knock smaller opponents off balance, disarm weapons, or inflict slashing damage.

## Special Abilities

### Climber’s Grip

Monitor lizards can traverse vertical and inverted surfaces with ease, using their sharp claws for grip; they gain bonuses to climbing and escaping checks, and can retreat to places opponents cannot easily follow.

### Swift Strike

Monitor lizards have quick reflexes and gain bonuses to initiative and to reaction checks; they can sometimes take additional actions during combat due to their speed and agility.

### Aquatic Hunter

Monitor lizards are equally at home in water as on land, able to hold breath for extended periods and move with perfect grace through aquatic environments.
