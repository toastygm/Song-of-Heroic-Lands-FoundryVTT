# Appearance {#appearance}

The jungle canopy is a cathedral of green, and the bird moves through it like a fragment of stained glass come to life. You hear the call first — a soft, fluting whistle that rises and falls like a question asked of the forest itself — and then a flash of color so vivid it seems impossible in a world of leaf and shadow. The breast is a red so deep it looks like arterial blood caught in light. The head and back are iridescent green — not merely green but a green that shifts to gold and turquoise and back again with every movement, as if the feathers are made of liquid metal rather than keratin. But the tail is what stops your breath. Two feathers, impossibly long — three feet of emerald ribbon streaming behind a bird no larger than a pigeon — ripple and undulate in the humid air as the quetzal moves from branch to branch, each landing a momentary sculpture of color against the dark canopy. The Ki'ichek say that when the gods needed to mark something as holy, they caught a piece of the sky and gave it feathers. Watching this bird, you understand why its plumage is worth more than gold, why killing one is punishable by death, and why the priest-kings wear its feathers as proof of divine authority.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Quetzal is the most sacred bird in the lowland jungles of [[doc-kchchkcntnnt|K'ich'chik Continent]] — a small, brilliantly colored trogon whose iridescent green tail feathers are the single most valuable natural material in Ki'ichek civilization, worth literally more than their weight in gold. The bird itself is modest in size — roughly twelve inches of body with tail streamers adding another two to three feet — and weighs barely half a pound. But its cultural weight is immeasurable. The quetzal's feathers adorn the headdresses of priest-kings and high priests, and their possession marks the wearer as divinely sanctioned. The bird is associated with the wind deity and with the concept of freedom itself — the Ki'ichek say the quetzal cannot survive captivity, that it will die rather than be caged. Whether this is literally true or an expression of the bird's sacred status, the result is the same: quetzals are not kept in cages, and their feathers must be obtained by trapping birds alive, removing a few tail feathers, and releasing them unharmed. Professional quetzal trappers are a specialized and respected class, and the trade in quetzal feathers is controlled by the temples. Killing a quetzal — whether deliberately or through careless trapping — is a capital offense throughout [[doc-kchchkcntnnt|K'ich'chik Continent]]. Adventurers encounter the quetzal primarily as a symbol: on temple walls, in feather-work headdresses, and in the reverent tones of anyone who speaks of it. Seeing one in the wild is considered a profound blessing.

## Presentation

The quetzal is a small bird of staggering beauty. The male's plumage is what has earned it sacred status: the head, back, and upper breast are covered in iridescent feathers that shift between emerald green, gold, and turquoise depending on the angle of light — a structural coloration produced by microscopic feather architecture rather than pigment, which makes the color seem to glow from within. The lower breast and belly are deep crimson. The head bears a rounded crest of green feathers that gives it a helmeted appearance. The beak is short and yellow. The eyes are large and dark, adapted for the dim light of the forest interior. But the defining feature is the male's tail: two upper tail coverts that extend far beyond the true tail, forming flowing streamers of iridescent green that can exceed three feet in length — longer than the bird's entire body several times over. These streamers ripple and undulate during flight, creating an effect so striking that it has inspired an entire artistic and religious tradition. The female is more subdued — green above, gray below, with shorter tail coverts — but still beautiful by any ordinary standard.

## Key Behaviors

Quetzals are solitary or paired birds that inhabit the cloud forest canopy — the mist-shrouded mountain forests between the lowland jungles and the highland plateau. They are frugivorous, feeding primarily on small fruits which they pluck in hovering flight, though they also take insects, small frogs, and lizards. The male's tail streamers are central to courtship: during display flights, the male ascends above the canopy and spirals downward with the streamers flowing behind, creating a visual spectacle visible at great distance. Quetzals nest in tree cavities, and the male's long tail feathers protrude from the hole entrance during incubation — a vulnerability that makes nesting birds easier to locate. They are shy, retiring birds that avoid human activity, preferring the deepest and most undisturbed sections of cloud forest. Their call — a soft, melodious whistle — is considered one of the most beautiful bird sounds in K'ich'chik and features in temple music and poetry.

## Combat Strategy

The quetzal has no combat strategy. It is a small, fragile bird that flees from any threat by disappearing into the canopy, where its green plumage provides effective camouflage despite its brilliance — in the dappled green light of the cloud forest, the iridescent feathers become surprisingly difficult to track. A cornered quetzal will peck and flutter, but this is desperation, not defense.

## Attack Methods

### Beak Peck

A small, sharp beak capable of piercing fruit — functionally useless as a weapon against anything larger than an insect. Mentioned only for completeness.

## Special Abilities

### Freedom or Death

The Ki'ichek believe the quetzal cannot survive captivity — that it will die of despair rather than endure a cage. Whether this is literal physiology (the bird is fragile and stress-sensitive) or cultural mythology elevated to law, the practical effect is absolute: quetzals are never caged, and the elaborate live-trapping and release system used to harvest feathers is built around this principle.

### Sacred Immunity

The quetzal's protected status in K'ich'chik surpasses even the peacock's in Vedyara or the crane's in Tānvür. Killing a quetzal is a capital offense — the perpetrator may be sacrificed to the wind deity. This protection extends to the cloud forest habitat, and logging or clearing land where quetzals nest requires temple dispensation that is almost never granted. The economic value of quetzal feathers, combined with the death penalty for killing the birds, has created an entire specialized profession of live-trappers whose techniques are closely guarded guild secrets.

### Canopy Camouflage

Despite its vivid coloration, the quetzal is remarkably difficult to spot in its natural habitat. The iridescent green feathers match the play of light through cloud forest canopy almost exactly, and a motionless quetzal on a moss-covered branch is effectively invisible until it moves or calls.
