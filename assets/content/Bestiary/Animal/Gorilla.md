# Appearance {#appearance}

The sound comes first—a deep, reverberating roar that makes your bones vibrate. The gorilla steps into view, and your perspective on size recalibrates. The creature stands nearly eight feet tall, and the sheer density of muscle across its chest and arms is overwhelming. The dark hair is thick and coarse, and across the back and shoulders you see the distinctive silvering that marks an alpha male. The eyes are deeply set but expressive, burning with intelligence and protective fury. The arms are disproportionately massive, hanging partway down the legs. Then the gorilla beats its chest—a thunderous percussion that echoes across the landscape—and the display is so perfectly timed to the roar that you understand you are witnessing a creature asserting absolute dominion over its territory.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Gorilla is a massive, supremely intelligent primate that lives in family groups (troops) centered on an alpha male (the silverback). These are generally peaceful herbivores that cause little trouble unless provoked or unless their group is threatened. However, a silverback defending its troop is a nightmare of muscle and determination—capable of matching or exceeding humanoid warriors in physical combat. Adventurers most commonly encounter gorillas when exploring deep jungles or when trespassing into territory the gorillas claim.

## Presentation

A mature silverback gorilla is an overwhelming physical presence. The creature stands seven to eight feet tall and can weigh several hundred pounds, nearly all of it muscle and bone. The body is powerfully built with an upright or semi-upright posture, long arms that hang nearly to the knees, and legs built to support the immense weight. The hair is dark brown or black, with the characteristic silvering across the back and shoulders that marks a mature male. The face is distinctly primate in structure, with deep-set eyes, a broad nose, and prominent teeth. The hands are large with powerful fingers and opposable thumbs. The overall impression is of a creature that is not humanoid but not fully animal either—something caught in between, possessed of remarkable intelligence and emotional complexity.

## Key Behaviors

Gorillas live in social groups of eight to fifteen individuals led by a dominant silverback male. The group spends most of the day foraging for vegetation, fruits, and leaves in a defined territory. They are primarily diurnal and follow established movement patterns within their range. They communicate through vocalizations, gestures, and displays, and there is clear social hierarchy and affection within groups. Silverbacks are highly protective of their troop and will intervene in conflicts between subordinates or to protect young. An infant gorilla is nursed for several years, creating strong bonds between mothers and offspring.

## Combat Strategy

A silverback defending its troop begins with intimidating displays—chest-beating, roaring, and aggressive charging—designed to frighten intruders away. If these displays fail to deter an opponent, the gorilla engages in direct combat with overwhelming strength and power. The silverback uses its massive arms to grapple, strike, and throw opponents, and will not disengage from combat if a threat to its troop remains. A silverback's tactics are straightforward: overwhelm through sheer force and size. The silverback fights with intelligence and experience, using leverage and positioning to maximum advantage.

## Attack Methods

### Crushing Bite

The gorilla's powerful jaws deliver a bite capable of crushing bone—the teeth are designed as weapons, sharp and strong enough to puncture thick hide or leather. A bite from a gorilla is debilitating and potentially lethal.

### Devastating Punch

The gorilla's massive arms deliver strikes with terrible force—a punch from a silverback is capable of breaking bones, shattering armor, or driving a target backward. These strikes are slow but tremendously powerful.

### Grapple and Throw

The gorilla's strength advantage is used to grapple opponents and control them—pinning them to the ground or throwing them with force sufficient to cause serious injury. A grappled target is in grave danger.

## Special Abilities

### Intimidating Presence

The silverback's displays—chest-beating, roaring, and aggressive charging—are designed to frighten and intimidate. A creature facing a silverback's display must maintain composure or risk fleeing or becoming paralyzed with fear.

### Protective Fury

When the silverback's troop is threatened, the gorilla's combat effectiveness increases—it becomes more aggressive and shows less concern for its own safety. A silverback defending its young will pursue threats indefinitely.

## Additional Information

A silverback gorilla's strength is legendary, and some cultures revere them as forest spirits or embodiments of protective power. A gorilla that has not been provoked will rarely attack, though they will enforce boundaries around their territory. Attempting to separate a gorilla from its troop is supremely dangerous. Some indigenous peoples report negotiating peace with gorilla troops through specific gestures and respectful behavior.
