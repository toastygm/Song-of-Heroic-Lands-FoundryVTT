# Appearance {#appearance}

Shaggy fur hangs in matted clumps, shifting as the massive creature moves with deceptive grace across difficult terrain. The horn is dark and rough, curving forward slightly, clearly scarred and aged from countless uses. Each exhalation produces mist in the cold air. The broad shoulders and sturdy build speak to a creature built for surviving frozen wastelands, a behemoth of patience and territorial resolve.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Woolly Rhino is a massive grazer standing 6-7 feet at the shoulder and reaching up to 13-14 feet in body length, found exclusively in tundra and cold steppe regions. These solitary herbivores are fundamentally peaceful but fiercely territorial and dangerous when defending range or young. Adventurers encounter them primarily while traveling through arctic regions or when mistaken for threatening the creature.

## Presentation

The woolly rhino is massive and heavily built with a thick brownish-gray coat that hangs in clumps for insulation. The signature feature is the large forward-curving horn of dense keratin reaching 4-5 feet in length, often scarred and darkened with age. Broad shoulders and sturdy legs support the creature’s weight across difficult terrain.

## Key Behaviors

Woolly rhinos are solitary grazers that spend much of their time foraging in harsh tundra environments. They are fiercely territorial and will defend feeding grounds aggressively, particularly during mating season. They are intelligent about remembering dangerous locations and adjusting movement patterns.

## Combat Strategy

The woolly rhino charges at threats with all its weight and power behind its horn. If cornered or defending young, it becomes relentless and will continue attacking until the threat is eliminated or departs.

## Attack Methods

### Horn Charge

The rhino charges with all its weight concentrated behind the horn, capable of impaling and throwing opponents.

### Trampling Stomp

The creature’s hooves deliver crushing blows to targets on the ground.

## Special Abilities

### Charge Momentum

The rhino’s charge over distance gains additional force and impact.

### Cold Adaptation

The thick fur provides genuine protection against extreme cold and minor insulation against slashing attacks.

### Relentless Territorial Defense

Within claimed territory, the rhino fights with enhanced determination and refuses to retreat.

### Additional Information

Woolly rhinos are most dangerous when defending territory or young. In open terrain, their charging advantage is maximized. The creature’s horn can be harvested after death and is valuable for crafting and decoration.
