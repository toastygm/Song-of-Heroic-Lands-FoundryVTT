# Appearance {#appearance}

The first sign is the sound—a series of rising pant-hoots that chill the blood, echoing through the canopy with primal intensity. Then the figure emerges: a powerful, dark-haired form swinging from branch to branch with acrobatic grace. As it descends closer, you see the musculature, the bare face and hands of startling intelligence, and then the lips peel back in a threat display that reveals massive canines. The creature lets out a full, aggressive screech that echoes through your chest. Its eyes—intelligent, calculating, and utterly devoid of compassion—fix directly on you.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The chimpanzee is a primate of frightening intelligence and savage capability. Standing four to five and a half feet tall and weighing ninety to two hundred pounds depending on sex, these creatures possess intelligence comparable to human children, a memory of faces and grievances that rivals human capacity, and a propensity for calculated violence that exceeds most predators. Unlike bears or big cats, which kill by instinct, chimpanzees plan, coordinate, and pursue revenge with vindictive precision. They live in hierarchical societies where dominance struggles determine access to resources and mating, and these struggles are settled through violence. Adventurers may encounter chimpanzees while exploring tropical forests, investigating lost civilizations in jungle regions, or being pursued by organized groups of these creatures that view humans as territorial rivals or threats to social hierarchy.

## Presentation

A powerful primate with proportionally long arms—the span from hand to hand equals or exceeds the creature’s height. The body is compact and heavily muscled, particularly in the shoulders, chest, and back. The head is large with a pronounced brow ridge, small ears set to the sides, and a face that, while ape-like, conveys an unsettling impression of intelligence. The eyes are dark and expressive, capable of showing emotions and intentions clearly. The mouth is large with substantial canine teeth visible when the creature displays threat or bares teeth. The skin is bare on the face and hands, typically dark brown or black, while the rest of the body is covered in dark hair typically dark brown or black. Mature males develop pronounced muscle tone and sometimes acquire a speckled appearance as darker hairs emerge. The knuckles of the hands are pronounced and heavily callused, adapted for knuckle-walking. Every individual shows scars from past battles—claw marks, bite wounds, torn ears, or damaged eyes. These scars are badges of survival and status within their groups.

## Key Behaviors

Chimpanzees live in societies of fifteen to eighty individuals organized around a complex hierarchy. Dominance is established and maintained through displays of strength, coalition building, and violence. Adult males form the core of social structure, with alliances determining who holds power. Females are typically subordinate but possess their own hierarchies. Remarkably, chimpanzees wage war—distinct groups defend territories and engage in organized raids against neighboring groups, sometimes killing all members of the rival group they encounter. They are intensely territorial, patrolling boundaries and attacking intruders without mercy. Within their group, they show extraordinary social bonds: mothers and offspring remain close, coalitions form and dissolve, and individuals show genuine grief when group members die. They use tools regularly: sharpened sticks for hunting, stones for cracking nuts, moss for carrying water. They hunt, cooperatively bringing down monkeys and other animals through coordinated effort. They have learned to fear humans and fire, and this fear is transmitted through generations.

## Combat Strategy

Chimpanzees rarely engage in solitary combat if alternatives exist. When they do fight, they fight with calculated ferocity. A single chimp may flee from a lone human if uncertain of the outcome, but a group will coordinate attacks: some creating distraction while others attack from behind or above, some throwing objects while others close for combat. They target vulnerable areas: eyes, face, genitals, and extremities. Once they have disabled an opponent’s ability to defend, they will inflict maximum damage through biting and striking. They have learned from experience and will use terrain to advantage, fighting from trees if possible, using elevation to launch attacks. Their intelligence allows them to anticipate human reactions and exploit weaknesses.

## Attack Methods

### Bite with Canine Teeth

The chimpanzee lunges and attempts to bite, targeting the face, shoulder, or limb with terrible force. The massive canine teeth can penetrate muscle, crack bone, and cause catastrophic damage. A bite to the face can blind, disfigure, or tear away tissue. Bites to the neck or extremities can sever arteries and cause death through blood loss. The bite is followed by violent shaking to increase damage.

### Grappling and Throwing

Using its powerful arms, the chimp attempts to seize and control an opponent, then either throw them (causing impact damage) or pin them for additional attacks. A human thrown by a chimpanzee can suffer serious injury from impact. A pinned human is helpless against additional bites and strikes.

### Projectile Throwing

Chimpanzees will hurl rocks, sticks, fruit husks, and other objects with surprising accuracy and force. While individual projectiles cause less damage than close combat, a barrage of objects can demoralize opponents and create opportunities for closer attacks. Multiple chimpanzees throwing simultaneously can cover an opponent effectively.

### Pummeling and Striking

Using fists, the chimp delivers powerful blows, typically to the torso, face, or extremities. These strikes are less devastating than bites but serve to disable and disorient opponents.

## Special Abilities

### Brutal Intelligence and Coordination

Chimpanzees are not merely intelligent animals—they are calculating predators capable of complex planning, deception, and coordination. A group of chimpanzees will execute elaborate ambushes, coordinate attacks, and communicate during combat. They remember individual humans and hold grudges, planning attacks that account for known human capabilities. This intelligence makes them far more dangerous than animals relying on instinct alone.

### Preternatural Strength and Climbing Ability

A chimpanzee’s strength exceeds human capability by a factor of three to five, allowing them to move through forest canopy with effortless grace and inflict damage that seems impossible given their size. They can ascend vertical surfaces, swing from branch to branch with one arm while carrying additional weight, and exert force that humans cannot resist. This advantage in vertical terrain is particularly significant—humans are disadvantaged fighting creatures in trees.

### Fearlessness and Pain Tolerance

Once committed to combat, a chimpanzee fights with suicidal determination. Pain and injury do not cause retreat—injured chimpanzees often become more aggressive. This fearlessness, combined with their physical capability, makes them extraordinarily dangerous opponents that do not break from combat easily.

### Organized Group Tactics

Multiple chimpanzees hunting together employ tactics suggesting military training. They create numerical superiority, attack from multiple angles, use distraction and misdirection, and focus force against the weakest opponent to eliminate threats systematically. A group of five or more chimpanzees can overwhelm significantly larger human forces through superior coordination.
