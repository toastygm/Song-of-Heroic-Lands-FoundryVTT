# Appearance {#appearance}

A compact, muscular frame stands before you, no taller than a man's chest, yet projecting an unmistakable solidity. The pony's coat is thick and weathered, its mane shaggy and seemingly never fully combed, and its stocky legs appear barely adequate to support the creature's substance. Yet there is a quality of independence to it — intelligence showing in dark eyes that assess you with a practicality you wouldn't expect from a mere working animal. The smell of hay and honest sweat clings to it, mixed with the scent of earth and thistles.

# Dossier {#dossier}

Ponies are stocky, strong equines standing under fourteen hands (approximately 56 inches) at the shoulder, built for endurance and labor rather than speed or elegance. These adaptable creatures are found throughout farmland, hills, and rough terrain across settled lands, serving as draft animals, farm workers, and reliable mounts for smaller riders or dwarves. Adventurers might encounter a pony as a working animal left unattended, integrated into a traveling caravan, or encountered on roads and hill paths where they work their owners' land.

## Presentation

The pony presents a concentrated muscular form with thick neck, broad chest, and powerful legs disproportionately thick for its body size. Its coat is characteristically dense and coarse, often shades of gray, brown, chestnut, or black, sometimes marked with lighter dun coloring or primitive striping. The mane is thick and often full and unruly, while the tail is characteristically heavy and full. The head is broader than a horse's, with smaller ears and a sturdier jaw. Adult ponies typically weigh 500-800 pounds and can carry significant weight for their size. The eyes are intelligent and alert, marked with a personality and stubbornness that distinguishes them from horses.

## Key Behaviors

Ponies are intelligent, opinionated animals that respond best to consistent handling and develop strong personalities around their regular handlers. They are capable of extraordinary endurance and will work steadily through difficult conditions without complaint, though they will actively resist bad treatment or unreasonable demands. Ponies are herd animals but thrive equally well in isolation, becoming attached to individual handlers or other animals they live alongside. They are curious, methodical in their approach to problems, and possess excellent memory — a pony that encounters a situation remembers it years later. Compared to horses, ponies are considerably less inclined to panic and are practical in their assessment of danger.

## Combat Strategy

A pony will not initiate combat and prefers to flee or simply remove itself from danger. If cornered, separated from its herd, or defending a foal, it becomes a formidable opponent despite its size. Rather than rearing dramatically, the pony uses low, powerful kicks and determined bites to drive away threats. It fights with dogged pragmatism, neither theatrical nor flashy, pressing the attack until the threat withdraws. A pony separated from its handler becomes confused and less effective in combat, though fear may still drive it to violence if trapped.

## Attack Methods

### Powerful Kick

The pony swings a muscular hind leg in a low, powerful arc, using its compact build to generate surprising force in a short arc. This attack is effective at disabling approaching threats and has enough power to crack ribs or shatter bone in arms or legs.

### Bite

If a threat comes within reach, the pony may bite with considerable force, using its broad jaw to crush fingers, tear through leather, or inflict puncture wounds on unarmored flesh.

### Shoulder Check

In rare instances, the pony may lower its head and drive forward with its whole body, using its concentrated weight to knock opponents off balance or drive them backward.

## Special Abilities

### Hardy Endurance

The pony is built for long-distance work in difficult conditions. It can travel for extended periods at steady pace without tiring, subsisting on forage that would barely sustain horses. The pony is naturally resistant to cold, heat, and deprivation, making it reliable in harsh terrain.

### Powerful Legs

Beneath the stocky frame lies extraordinary muscular development in the legs. The pony can jump higher than its size suggests, climb steep slopes, and generate power in its kicks far exceeding what a human could manage.

### Practical Determination

The pony possesses an uncanny ability to find its way across difficult terrain, assess the safest route, and move with confidence even on uncertain ground. This contributes to its effectiveness as a pack animal and working animal in wild lands.

### Honest Stubbornness

The pony will not be driven beyond what it judges reasonable — a pony that refuses to proceed does so because it has identified a genuine hazard (thin ice, unstable slope, dangerous animal) that its instinct rejects. Wise handlers listen to this obstinacy rather than forcing compliance.

### Additional Information

Ponies can be trained by younger or smaller humanoids without requiring the strength needed to handle full horses. They develop fierce attachment to their handlers and will actively mourn separation or death. A well-treated pony becomes a steady, reliable companion worth its weight in practical assistance. Conversely, a pony subjected to cruelty becomes vindictive and dangerous, finding creative ways to injure or escape abusive handlers.
