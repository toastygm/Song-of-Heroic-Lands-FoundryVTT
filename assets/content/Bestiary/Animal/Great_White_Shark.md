# Appearance {#appearance}

The water around you grows cold. You see the shadow first—an enormous silhouette gliding beneath the surface with terrible grace. Then the shark itself rises: a creature of pure predatory design, gray above and white below, its body a hydrodynamic perfection built for nothing but hunting. The eyes are cold and reptilian, utterly without mercy or concern. When the shark opens its jaws, you see rows of serrated teeth sharp enough to shred armor, and the mouth is large enough to swallow a humanoid whole. The fin cuts the water, and you feel with bone-deep certainty that you are in the presence of something utterly beyond your capacity to resist.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Great White Shark is an apex ocean predator, a creature that has remained virtually unchanged for millions of years because it is perfectly suited to hunting in its domain. These solitary hunters patrol deep and shallow waters, killing anything that enters their territory. A great white shark can exceed twenty feet in length and weighs several tons—a creature built entirely for hunting and killing with maximum efficiency. Adventurers encounter them only when sailing or swimming in shark territory, and such encounters typically end in disaster.

## Presentation

The Great White Shark is a masterwork of predatory design: a streamlined body tapering from broad shoulders to a powerful tail, covered in smooth gray skin above and white below. The coloring provides counterillumination camouflage, making the shark nearly invisible from above against the dark depths and from below against the light surface. The head tapers to a pointed snout (the rostrum) with nostrils positioned to sample water chemistry. The eyes are small and positioned to the sides of the head, providing good lateral vision but limited forward binocular sight. The mouth is enormous and filled with serrated teeth arranged in multiple rows—functional teeth positioned further back and replacement teeth gradually moving forward as older teeth wear away. The dorsal fin is distinctive—large and triangular, used for stability and steering. The tail is crescent-shaped and powerful, generating the force for movement and attack.

## Key Behaviors

Great White Sharks are solitary hunters that patrol vast territories, using their extraordinary senses to detect prey. They hunt seals, dolphins, large fish, and anything else that enters their domain. They hunt primarily through ambush from below—approaching prey from depths where they cannot be seen, then striking with explosive force. They are sensitive to electrical fields (generated by muscle contractions in other creatures) and can detect movement from considerable distances. They feed infrequently (every few weeks or months for large prey) and digest slowly over extended periods.

## Combat Strategy

A Great White's attack is designed for one-hit killing—the initial bite is intended to be catastrophic, severing limbs or killing instantly. If the initial strike succeeds, the shark retreats to wait for the prey to weaken before feeding. If the strike fails or if the prey survives, the shark may make additional strikes, though it generally does not engage in prolonged combat. A shark in confined space (like a ship or shallow water) becomes more predictable and aggressive, making repeated attacks rather than retreating.

## Attack Methods

### Devastating Bite

The shark's bite is one of the most powerful in the animal kingdom—rows of serrated teeth deliver crushing force capable of severing limbs, smashing bone, and inflicting catastrophic trauma. A successful bite is nearly always fatal or crippling.

### Ramming Charge

The shark uses its massive body weight and speed to ram prey, knocking them off balance or into deeper water. The impact alone can cause serious injury.

## Special Abilities

### Apex Hunter

The shark's senses are supremely keen—it can detect electrical fields, smell blood from miles away, and sense movement through water vibrations. The shark is nearly impossible to surprise in water.

### Aquatic Mastery

In water, the Great White is supremely graceful and fast, capable of striking faster than humanoid reflexes can follow. Out of water, the shark is helpless.

## Additional Information

A Great White Shark's territory should be avoided—the risk is simply too great. Some cultures revere sharks as embodiments of power or hunting prowess. A dead shark's teeth can be worked into weapons or jewelry. The jaw of a great white shark is legendary.
