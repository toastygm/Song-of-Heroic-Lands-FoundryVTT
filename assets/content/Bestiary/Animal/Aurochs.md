# Appearance {#appearance}

The ground trembles before you see it. A mountain of muscle and matted fur emerges from the grassland, shoulders heaving with each labored breath. The reek of musk and wet earth fills the air as the creature tilts its massive head, revealing horns the length of a man’s arm, sharp as spear points and darkened with use. Its pale underbelly stripe gleams against its coal-black hide, and the sound it makes—a low, rumbling snort—vibrates through your bones.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Aurochs is the apex of wild bovine evolution: a creature of prehistoric power and untamed temperament. Standing over six feet tall at the shoulder and weighing upward of two thousand pounds, these massive cattle haunt grasslands and sparse forests across multiple continents. They are rarely encountered singly; where one Aurochs appears, others linger nearby. Adventurers pursuing lost herds, investigating trampled settlements, or seeking to prove their prowess may cross paths with these formidable creatures.

## Presentation

A colossal creature built on a framework of iron sinew and dense bone. Shaggy black hair, four to six inches thick, covers its body except for a distinctive cream or pale gold stripe running from shoulder to rump, which stands out starkly against the dark coat. Its curving horns arc outward and upward, each measuring three to four feet long, with a wickedly sharp point and a slightly forward hook. The nose is broad and square, capable of snorting clouds of dust when agitated. Its hooves are the size of a man’s clenched fist. The creature’s eyes, small relative to its head size, miss little movement in its environment.

## Key Behaviors

Aurochs maintain small, matriarchal herds of four to twelve individuals. They spend most daylight hours grazing in open grasslands where they can watch for threats, seeking denser forest cover only during the hottest parts of summer or when predators become uncomfortably persistent. Cows with calves are extraordinarily aggressive and will defend their young against anything, including much larger predators. Even solitary bulls will charge at what they perceive as territorial intrusion or disrespect. Despite their size and strength, Aurochs are not mindless brutes—they are intelligent enough to remember dangerous threats, avoid known hunting grounds, and modify their routes seasonally. A bull’s temperament depends heavily on season; during rutting months (late autumn), they become notably more irascible and dangerous.

## Combat Strategy

An Aurochs rarely hesitates to confront a threat head-on. When it perceives danger, it lowers its head, stamps once or twice as a warning, then charges with surprising speed for an animal of its bulk. Its strategy is simple but devastatingly effective: drive the point of a horn through the target, fling the impaled opponent skyward, or slam them with the broad mass of its head and neck. If surrounded or cornered, it will rear and stomp with forelegs, then wheel to drive enemies backward with horn thrusts. Herds amplify this danger—panicked Aurochs may stampede, and multiple individuals will often attack from different angles, making coordinated defense nearly impossible. A herd in full flight can level a wooden structure or trample a small company of soldiers.

## Attack Methods

### Gore with Horns

The Aurochs drives forward with tremendous force, seeking to impale with its long, curved horns and hurl the target upward and backward. The force of the charge imparts both penetrating damage from the points and blunt trauma from the skull and neck behind them. Multiple adventurers have been tossed ten feet or more through the air before crashing to earth.

### Trample

Once an opponent is knocked down or flanked, the Aurochs will deliberately step on them with legs like pillars, crushing bone and armor alike. Each hooffall carries the weight of over two thousand pounds concentrated into a point no larger than a man’s palm.

### Skull Slam

When at close quarters or surrounded, the creature swings its massive head like a club, using the thick bone of its skull more than the horns themselves. This battering attack is less precise than a goring charge but effective against multiple foes.

## Special Abilities

### Thick Hide and Dense Build

An Aurochs’s hide is naturally thick and overlaid with dense fur that sheds water and provides surprising protection against slashing weapons. Its muscle and bone density exceed that of ordinary cattle by a factor of three or more, allowing it to absorb impacts that would cripple lesser creatures. Slashing weapons are notably less effective than piercing or blunt trauma.

### Aggressive Temperament

Once provoked, an Aurochs pursues its aggressor with single-minded determination. It will not break off an attack simply because a foe retreats; instead, it will charge until the target is down, beyond its reach, or it loses the scent. In herds, this aggressive behavior propagates—one attacking Aurochs may trigger simultaneous charges from others.

### Keen Hearing and Smell

Despite small eyes, Aurochs rely heavily on hearing and scent. They can detect movement and danger at considerable distance, making surprise difficult. They will circle a potential threat, determining its size and threat level through smell alone before committing to an attack.
