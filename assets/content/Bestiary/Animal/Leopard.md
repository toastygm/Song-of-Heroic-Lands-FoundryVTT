# Appearance {#appearance}

You do not see it. That is the point. You hear a sound — a scrape of claw on bark, the creak of a branch that should not creak — and you look up into the canopy and find death looking back at you. It lies along a limb with the boneless ease of something that has been waiting there for hours, perfectly still, perfectly patient. The coat is gold shading to amber, broken by rosettes of black that dissolve the outline of the animal into the dappled light until it is nearly invisible. The eyes are the only thing that moves — pale green or gold, fixed on you with the absolute concentration of a predator that has already decided. The body is compact and dense with muscle, smaller than a lion but built with a taut, coiled power that suggests every ounce serves a purpose. The tail hangs down, the tip twitching once. When it moves, it moves all at once — a liquid pour of spotted fur that is on the ground and then simply gone, vanished into the underbrush with a silence that makes you question whether you saw anything at all.

# Dossier {#dossier}

The Leopard is the supreme ambush predator of the Kheperi eastern hills and river forests — a solitary, nocturnal cat of extraordinary stealth, power, and adaptability. An adult male weighs between a hundred and two hundred pounds, with females somewhat smaller, making the leopard significantly smaller than a lion but pound-for-pound one of the strongest and most dangerous cats in the world. Leopards are solitary, territorial, and almost exclusively nocturnal, hunting from ambush with a patience and precision that makes them the most feared predator in regions where they are common. They are the only large cat that routinely carries prey into trees to cache it, hauling carcasses three times their own weight into the canopy to protect kills from lions, hyenas, and other scavengers. In Kheperi culture, leopard skins are symbols of priestly authority — high priestesses wear leopard-skin robes, and the animals themselves are associated with sacred feminine power and divine wrath. This cultural significance makes leopards both hunted (for their skins) and protected (by religious prohibition against casual killing), creating a complex relationship between human settlements and the cats that prowl their margins. Adventurers encounter leopards in the forested hills east of the Tameresh, along rocky river gorges, in the acacia woodlands that border the desert, and occasionally within settlements where a bold or desperate leopard has taken to hunting livestock or dogs.

## Presentation

A medium-large cat of compact, muscular build — shorter and heavier-boned than a lion, with a broad head, powerful jaw, and relatively short, thick legs. The coat is short and dense, golden-yellow to tawny across the back and flanks, shading to white on the belly, covered in a pattern of dark rosettes — clusters of spots arranged in broken circles that provide extraordinary camouflage in dappled forest light. The head is broad with small, rounded ears, and the eyes are large and pale — green, gold, or amber — with round pupils that expand in darkness to gather maximum light. The whiskers are long and sensitive, essential for navigating tight spaces during nocturnal hunts. The paws are broad, with retractable claws that are kept razor-sharp through constant use and maintenance. The tail is long and thick, serving as a counterbalance during climbing and leaping. The overall impression is of a creature designed for maximum lethality in minimum size — every element of the leopard's anatomy serves the purpose of killing with speed, silence, and overwhelming force.

## Key Behaviors

Leopards are strictly solitary outside of mating and cub-rearing. An adult male maintains a territory of fifteen to thirty square miles, overlapping with the territories of several females but defended viciously against rival males. Territory is marked with urine, scat, and claw marks on prominent trees. Leopards are primarily nocturnal, spending daylight hours resting in dense cover, rock crevices, or draped along tree branches. They hunt at night with a patience that borders on the pathological — a leopard may stalk a single prey animal for hours, closing the distance inch by inch until it reaches striking range. The killing method is precise: a short, explosive rush from cover, followed by a throat bite or a skull bite that kills almost instantly. After the kill, the leopard drags the carcass into a tree, caching it in a fork of branches where it can feed undisturbed over several days. This caching behavior is unique among the large cats and reflects the leopard's need to protect its kills in an environment shared with larger, more dominant predators. Leopards are opportunistic and will eat virtually anything they can catch — from insects and rodents to antelope, young livestock, dogs, and occasionally humans. A leopard that develops a taste for human prey becomes one of the most dangerous animals in the world, combining its natural stealth with an understanding of human behavior patterns that allows it to hunt people with terrifying effectiveness.

## Combat Strategy

A leopard's entire approach to combat is built around ambush. It does not charge across open ground like a lion or bear — it stalks, positions, and strikes from concealment with an explosive burst of speed that closes the distance before the target can react. The preferred attack is from above — dropping from a tree branch or rock ledge onto the target's back, using the impact to drive the prey to the ground while simultaneously seizing the throat. Against humans, a leopard will stalk from cover and attack from behind, targeting isolated individuals at the margins of camps or on paths through dense vegetation. If a leopard's ambush is detected or fails, it will typically disengage immediately, vanishing into cover with startling speed. A leopard rarely commits to a prolonged fight — it prefers to break contact and attempt another ambush from a different angle. However, a cornered leopard or one defending cubs fights with a berserk ferocity that belies its relatively modest size, and a wounded leopard in dense cover is one of the most dangerous situations a hunter can face.

## Attack Methods

### Ambush Pounce

The leopard's signature attack. From concealment — a tree branch, a rock ledge, tall grass — the cat launches itself at the target in a short, explosive leap, driving its full weight into the target's back or shoulders. The impact alone can knock a human to the ground, and the claws are deployed on contact, sinking deep into the flesh to anchor the leopard to its prey.

### Throat Bite

Once on the target, the leopard seizes the throat with its powerful jaws, applying a crushing bite that collapses the windpipe and severs the blood supply to the brain. This is the killing bite — the leopard holds it until the prey stops moving. Against armored or protected targets, the leopard may instead bite the base of the skull or the back of the neck, attempting to sever the spine.

### Raking Claws

In close combat, the leopard uses its hind legs to rake the belly and legs of its target with repeated, powerful kicks that drive the rear claws through clothing and flesh. This disemboweling motion is instinctive and devastatingly effective — a leopard that has secured a grip with its forepaws and teeth will rake continuously with the hind claws, inflicting catastrophic wounds in seconds.

### Hit and Fade

When facing alert opponents or groups, the leopard strikes from cover, inflicts damage, and immediately disengages into the surrounding terrain. It may circle and attack again from a completely different direction within minutes, using its knowledge of the local terrain to move unseen. Against groups, this tactic can create panic as the leopard picks off individuals one by one from the margins.

## Special Abilities

### Supreme Stealth

The leopard is the most effective ambush predator of its size class. Its spotted coat provides near-perfect camouflage in dappled light, and its movement through vegetation is almost completely silent. A leopard can approach within feet of its prey without being detected, and even experienced hunters may fail to spot a leopard in plain sight among the branches. At night, the leopard's stealth is absolute — its dark-adapted eyes allow it to navigate and hunt in conditions where humans are effectively blind.

### Arboreal Mastery

Leopards are powerful climbers, capable of ascending vertical tree trunks with explosive speed and descending headfirst with controlled grace. They can carry prey weighing more than their own body weight up into trees, using jaw strength and grip to haul carcasses into secure caching positions. This arboreal ability gives leopards access to refuges and ambush positions that are unavailable to ground-bound predators.

### Pound-for-Pound Power

Despite being smaller than lions, leopards possess extraordinary strength relative to their size. Their bite force and grip strength exceed what their body mass would suggest, and their muscular density allows them to overpower prey animals substantially heavier than themselves. A leopard is capable of killing animals twice its weight through technique and strength combined.

### Nocturnal Hunter

The leopard's eyes are specifically adapted for low-light conditions, with a reflective layer behind the retina that amplifies available light. In the darkness where it does most of its hunting, the leopard sees clearly while its prey — including humans — is effectively blind. This sensory advantage, combined with its natural stealth, makes the leopard an almost supernaturally effective nocturnal predator.
