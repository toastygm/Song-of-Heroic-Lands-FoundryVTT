A shelter of the commonest kind: a single room with a hearth at one end, a
stair at the other, and a door on the road side. Travellers who cannot reach a
town before dark sleep here and pay nothing for it.

# Common Room

Benches along three walls, a long table that is never moved, and floor rushes
that are changed when someone complains. Strangers arriving after dark are
looked over before they are spoken to.

# The Hearth

Banked rather than lit, most nights. The smoke bay above it is deep enough that
firelight does not carry into the room's corners.

# Stair Foot

A ladder-stair with a rail, rising to the loft. The rail stops a body but not a
line of sight, so whoever is above can see who has just come in.
