Half a floor, boarded over the common room's east end and open to it on the
west, so the hearth's warmth rises into the sleeping space and its noise with it.

# Sleeping Loft

Straw mattresses laid side by side under the roof slope. Nobody has a corner of
their own, and nothing left here is left safely.

# Stair Head

The top of the stair, railed on one side. From here the whole common room is
visible to anyone who cares to look down.
