/**
 * Neutralize placeable-`Token` canvas rendering in the headless test browser.
 *
 * Placing a Token on the auto-viewed scene makes core create a placeable `Token`
 * and render it — an initial `_draw`, then per-tick `applyRenderFlags` refreshes
 * driven by the PIXI ticker — but the headless test browser never initializes a
 * real viewport. Core's render chain then reaches for canvas infrastructure that
 * is absent and throws unhandled promise rejections at several points:
 * `TokenRuler.draw` → `GridLayer.addHighlightLayer` (`reading 'addChild'`) from
 * `_draw`, `_refreshState` → `RenderFlags.set` (`reading 'OBJECTS'`) from the
 * ticker refresh, and `_onAnimationUpdate` → `RenderFlags.set` (the same
 * `'OBJECTS'`) from any token **movement**. These land on whatever spec is
 * running, failing token-placing and token-moving specs nondeterministically.
 * Gating on `canvas.ready` is not enough — it can read `true` while the
 * token layer is still incomplete, so the refresh throws anyway.
 *
 * This suite never asserts on rendered token pixels — specs read the TokenDocument
 * and each combatant's Foundry-free `.logic` (and sheets via the DOM), never a
 * placeable's PIXI state (a viewport-dependent read is empty headless anyway; see
 * the testing docs). So we no-op the placeable's draw and render-flag flush
 * outright: the `Token` document and its `.object` still exist, only the PIXI
 * rendering (which has no test value here) is skipped. This is a narrower, safer
 * guard than allow-listing the generic `addChild`/`OBJECTS` messages globally,
 * which could mask a real error elsewhere, and it only patches core rendering that
 * this harness deliberately does not exercise. Installed once per page load
 * (idempotent); `testIsolation` is off, so one install per spec file covers all
 * its tests.

/**
 * Make a Region shape-constraint pass inert when it cannot do any work.
 *
 * Two separate core defects land in the same method, one build apart, and this
 * guard covers both. Neither predicate subsumes the other.
 *
 * **No scene is viewed.** A **restricted** Region
 * (`restriction.enabled`) makes core flag its scene's shape constraints for
 * recomputation, which it throttles and then defers to a PIXI ticker callback.
 * That callback picks the User designated to do the work with a predicate
 * reading `u.viewedScene === canvas.scene.id` — so wherever nothing is viewed
 * and `canvas.scene` is `null`, it throws `Cannot read properties of null
 * (reading 'id')` from the ticker, failing whichever spec happens to be running
 * at the time. Core fixed this in 14.367 by reading `this.id` instead, but the
 * guard stays: the suite's committed default is the `compatibility.minimum`
 * floor (14.359), which still carries the bug.
 *
 * Note that "headless" alone does **not** mean no scene is viewed: the seeded
 * world ships an **active** default scene (`package-build e2e seed`, #451),
 * which the client views at load, so `canvas.scene` is normally a live Scene.
 * It is `null` before that first draw completes, and in any run whose active
 * scene is absent or unviewed — which is the window this clause covers, and the
 * state `map-notes.cy.js` presents deliberately to test it.
 *
 * **The scene has been deleted.** 14.367 opened the public entry point
 * with `if ( !this.persisted ) throw new Error("A nonpersisted Document cannot
 * be updated.")`, and left callers that cannot honour it. The canvas's private
 * `#draw` calls it as the very last thing it does, after a long run of awaits
 * (`#initialize`, the `_onReady` manager event, the `canvasReady` hook, region
 * `BEHAVIOR_VIEWED` events). This suite deletes the scenes it creates —
 * `cy.cleanupWorld()` in `afterEach` — so a draw begun on a tagged scene
 * routinely finishes after that scene has left `game.scenes`. `persisted` is
 * false by then, the method throws, and since nothing awaits the tail of the
 * draw the rejection escapes unhandled onto a bystander spec. Note this scene
 * is *not* null — it is live, truthy and mid-draw, merely no longer in its
 * collection — which is why the `canvas.scene` clause above does not catch it.
 *
 * Both are **core** defects, not SoHL ones — nothing in the system's code is on
 * either stack. In both cases the call is made inert in exactly the situation
 * core cannot serve, which is what the caller assumed anyway: nothing here
 * asserts on shape constraints (they are canvas-perception state for a *viewed*
 * scene), and recomputing them for a document nobody can update has no work to
 * do. The `persisted` test is strict `=== false`, so on a build with no such
 * getter it reads `undefined` and the original runs untouched.
 *
 * **Coverage.** On `Scene`, both entry points are patched, because a Region
 * saving its shape reaches the private pass through
 * `_updateRegionShapeConstraints` (`Region#updateShapeConstraints({save: true})`
 * → `this.parent._updateRegionShapeConstraints(this)`) and never touches the
 * public flag — true on every supported build. Only the public one takes the
 * `persisted` clause: that is where core throws, and the private one has no such
 * check on any supported build.
 *
 * `Level` is patched separately. It carries its own copy of the
 * public method — new in 14.367; the 14.359 floor has no such member at all —
 * and throws from it *before* delegating, so the callers that address a level
 * directly (the levels a moved token affects, and the equivalent light and wall
 * updates) would not reach `Scene`'s guard. It needs no `canvas.scene` clause:
 * everything below its throw delegates to `Scene#_updateRegionShapeConstraints`,
 * which is guarded above. The floor's missing method is a no-op rather than an
 * error, via the `typeof` check.
 *
 * A source-level guard rather than an `uncaught:exception` allowlist entry, for
 * the same reason as {@link guardHeadlessTokenDraw}: both messages are far too
 * generic to leave allowlisted. `reading 'id'` sits one refactor away from
 * swallowing a real null dereference in system code, and "A nonpersisted
 * Document cannot be updated." is core's message for updating *any* deleted
 * document — either could mask a real SoHL bug. Skipping calls that can do no
 * work masks nothing.
 *
 * Installed once per page load, idempotent per prototype via its own marker;
 * `testIsolation` is off, so one install per spec file covers all its tests.
 *
 * @param {Window} win - the game client window.
