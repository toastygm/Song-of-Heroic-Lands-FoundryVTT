/**
 * Ignore known-benign async exceptions thrown by Foundry CORE (foundry.mjs) that
 * originate from UI rendering in the headless test browser (no canvas/viewport),
 * not from system behavior under test. Kept to an explicit allowlist of exact
 * messages so any other uncaught error still fails the spec.
 *
 * - CombatTracker._onRender: "Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'turn' in
 *   undefined" — the sidebar combat tracker re-renders on combat changes but has
 *   no active viewport in headless runs. Unrelated to combat data/logic.
 * - RegionShapeControls.refresh: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading
 *   'INTERFACE')" — creating a scene Region makes the canvas RegionLayer draw
 *   shape controls, which reads a canvas group that is absent headless (the
 *   region-trigger spec). Canvas rendering, not region-trigger logic.
 *
 * A restricted Region's shape-constraint pass used to be a third entry
 * here — `Scene#updateRegionShapeConstraints` throws `reading 'id'` out of a
 * PIXI ticker callback headless. It is now neutralized at the source instead,
 * by `guardHeadlessRegionShapeConstraints` in `commands.js`: `reading 'id'` is
 * far too generic a message to leave allowlisted, even qualified by a stack.
 *
 * An entry is `{message}` alone, or `{message, stack}` when the message is not
 * distinctive enough to be safe on its own — both must match.
