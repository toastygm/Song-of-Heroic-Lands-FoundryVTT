/**
 * Gear → encumbrance interaction, verified end-to-end on a live being:
 *
 * - Worn armor weight is *excluded* from the being's carried weight
 *   (and therefore encumbrance) — a fitted harness rides the body. The same
 *   armor carried but **not** worn counts its full weight like any other cargo.
 * - An armor's or weapon's optional per-item *encumbrance value* is
 *   added to the being's encumbrance while the item is in use (armor worn, a
 *   weapon carried), on top of the weight-derived base.
 *
 * Assertions are deltas (worn vs. not-worn, carried vs. not) so they hold
 * regardless of the Basic Folk baseline load, and the weight/encumbrance
 * dimensions are isolated per test.
