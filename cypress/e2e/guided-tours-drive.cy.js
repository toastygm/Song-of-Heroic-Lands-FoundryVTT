/**
 * The driven-tour capabilities: seeded-RNG mode and the drive-step
 * pipeline, driven against the live client.
 *
 * The headline is the **all-exit-paths RNG restore matrix** — the acceptance
 * criterion that a seeded tour returns `sohl.random` to normal no matter how it
 * ends (completion, abort, Escape, navigation, mid-step error). Restore rewinds
 * the shared stream to its exact pre-tour position, so "back to normal" is proven
 * by asserting the generator resumes the continuation it would have produced had
 * the tour never seeded it.
 *
 * No canvas is needed for the RNG matrix (it reads `sohl.random` directly), so it
 * is deterministic in headless runs.
