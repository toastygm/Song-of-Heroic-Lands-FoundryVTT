/**
 * Automated-combat start: target resolution.
 *
 * The combat tracker's **Automated Combat** entry builds its action context
 * with a speaker only (`SohlLogic.getContextOptions` supplies no `target`), so
 * `startAutomatedAttack` used to abort at once with "… automated attack
 * requires a target combatant" no matter what the player had targeted — the
 * whole flow was unreachable from the UI.
 *
 * This spec drives the deployed logic exactly as the tracker entry does — a
 * context carrying **no** target — with the opponent's token targeted, and
 * asserts the attack gets past target resolution. Two distinct regressions are
 * covered:
 *
 * 1. the target falls back to `fvttGetTargetedTokens()` (the same seam opposed
 *    tests use), so the "requires a target combatant" abort no longer fires; and
 * 2. the resolved target is handed to the attack dialog as the **defender**.
 *    `commonAttack` used to derive the defender from
 *    `context.scope.attackResult` — present only on the counterstrike path — so
 *    a start attack aborted a step later with "requires a valid defender
 *    combatant".
 *
 * Where it stops instead: these bare Beings carry no weapon, so strike-mode
 * selection finds nothing usable — "no usable strike mode". That is the step
 * *after* target and defender resolution, which is the point. Producing an
 * actual attack card needs a canvas and remains RED under #177 (see
 * `combat-automated.cy.js`).
