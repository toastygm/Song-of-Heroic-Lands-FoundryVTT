/**
 * Boon / Boost skill-affecting Mysteries.
 *
 * A `boon` Mystery contributes a flat ±N delta to its associated skill's EML; a
 * `boost` Mystery contributes the Mastery-Boost-table delta. Both are
 * live-derived — recomputed every prepare cycle and pushed onto the real skill's
 * `masteryLevel` — so the effect applies only while the Mystery is present and
 * reverts automatically when it lapses. Driven through the live `.logic`.
