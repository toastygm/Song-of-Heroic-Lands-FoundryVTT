/**
 * A deleted Scene is inert on the region-constraint path.
 *
 * Foundry 14.367 made `updateRegionShapeConstraints` throw
 * "A nonpersisted Document cannot be updated." unless `this.persisted`, but the
 * canvas calls it as the last step of its private draw, after a long run of
 * awaits. Because this suite deletes the scenes it creates in `afterEach`, a
 * draw begun on a tagged scene can finish after that scene has left
 * `game.scenes` — and the throw then escapes as an unhandled rejection onto
 * whichever spec is running next.
 *
 * That race is timing-dependent and only shows up under the load of a full
 * suite, where it lands on a bystander rather than on the spec that caused it.
 * So this spec asserts the *condition* directly instead of waiting for the
 * race: delete a scene, then invoke the same entry point the draw path does and
 * require it to be inert. `cy.login()`'s `guardHeadlessRegionShapeConstraints`
 * is what makes it so.
 *
 * That guard covers a second, unrelated defect too (#1535: no scene viewed), and
 * its clause for that one is tested *first*. Were `canvas.scene` `null` it would
 * short-circuit every call here and this spec would pass with the #1550 fix
 * reverted — so `withViewedScene` below pins the precondition the draw path
 * actually presents: a live, truthy `canvas.scene` that is merely no longer
 * persisted.
 *
 * `Level` is checked alongside `Scene` because it carries its own copy of the
 * method and throws from it *before* delegating to the scene, so the callers
 * that address a level directly — the levels a moved token affects, and the
 * equivalent light and wall updates — do not reach the scene's guard.
 *
 * The suite runs on two tracks, so the assertions have to hold on both, and the
 * two builds differ here: `Level` only gained its own copy of the method in
 * 14.367, and on the pinned 14.359 floor there is nothing to call and nothing
 * to guard. Hence the shape below — every entry point that *exists* must be
 * inert, rather than a fixed expectation of which ones exist. `persisted`
 * itself needs no such hedge: it reports `false` for a deleted scene and its
 * level on both builds, which the first test pins down.
