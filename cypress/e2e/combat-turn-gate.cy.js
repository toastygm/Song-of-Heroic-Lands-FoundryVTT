/**
 * Automated-combat turn gate.
 *
 * Only the current combatant may **start** an automated attack:
 * `SohlCombatantLogic.startAutomatedAttack` aborts up front via the pure
 * `outOfTurnAttackReason` helper. This spec drives the real logic against the
 * deployed FoundryHelpers shim and asserts the gate blocks end to end — the call
 * returns `undefined`, warns about the turn, and posts no attack card.
 *
 * The current-vs-other-combatant *distinction* is covered by the unit suite (the
 * pure `outOfTurnAttackReason` helper). This spec only proves the gate is wired
 * and blocks end to end, so it deterministically sets up an *out-of-turn* attack:
 * it points the combat's current turn at the **defender**, then drives the
 * attacker. The gate reads `getActiveCombat()?.combatant?.id` — i.e. the ambient
 * `game.combat`, whose resolution is viewport-dependent headless (`ui.combat.viewed`
 * when the tracker has rendered, else the first `isActive` combat; see
 * `game.combat` in core). Whichever it resolves to, the current combatant is never
 * the attacker, so the gate reports a *turn* reason — "it is not this combatant's
 * turn" (our combat) or "there is no active combat turn" (none) — and never falls
 * through to target validation. Earlier this test relied on `game.combat` being
 * `undefined` headless, which held only in isolation: once a preceding combat spec
 * rendered the tracker, `game.combat` resolved this spec's active combat with the
 * attacker current, the gate passed, and it warned about the target instead.
 * Pinning the turn removes that order dependence.
 *
 * The in-turn *pass* is still not e2e-reachable — the attack-start flow past the
 * gate is stubbed. See the skipped RED case at the end.
