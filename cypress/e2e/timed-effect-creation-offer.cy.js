/**
 * Creation-time offers for the recurring timed effects: a lasting
 * condition's recurring check is OFFERED when it is created, not auto-armed. Two
 * are covered here — a bleeder's **blood-loss advance** (offered as the wound is
 * inflicted) and an infection's **recovery course** (offered when a
 * critical-failure healing test contracts the infection).
 *
 * These specs are **about the offer**, so per the testing-doc rule of thumb they
 * press the REAL dialog button to model what the player now expects, rather than
 * pre-answering through a scripted `scope`. Three non-obvious facts shape how:
 *
 * 0. **RNG-gated creations are forced deterministic.** The infection only appears
 *    on a critical-failure healing test, so `SimpleRoll.forceValues(100)`
 *    drives that d100 to a critical failure — no flakiness.
 *
 * 1. **Two offers fire back-to-back.** Inflicting a bleeder wound
 *    (`createTraumaFromInjury`) offers the healing check *then* the blood-loss
 *    advance. Each now carries a per-effect title ("Set a Healing Check
 *    Reminder?" / "Set a Blood Loss Advance Reminder?"), so a spec answering a
 *    specific one uses `cy.submitDialogMatching(text, action)` to wait for it by
 *    content rather than `cy.submitDialog`'s "topmost dialog".
 * 2. **The queue arms asynchronously.** The reliable "arrived scheduled" fact is
 *    the synchronously-persisted `system.scheduledActions` store entry;
 *    `isScheduled` is read only after the driving action's promise has resolved.
