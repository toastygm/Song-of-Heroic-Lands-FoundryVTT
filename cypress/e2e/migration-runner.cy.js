/**
 * The version-keyed migration runner runs on `ready` for the active GM
 * and stamps `systemMigrationVersion` forward to the running system version.
 * These specs prove the runtime surface: the boot stamp, and that rewinding the
 * stored version and reloading re-runs the real `ready` path and re-stamps
 * forward (exercising the runner's plan → stamp path end to end through the live
 * lifecycle), plus the registered `0.9.0` step that strips `system.docUrl`.
 *
 * The `ready` hook fires `void migrateWorld()` (fire-and-forget), and the stamp
 * is a world-setting write that round-trips to the server — so `game.ready`
 * (what `cy.login()` waits on) can flip true *before* the migration's stamp
 * lands. Both specs therefore poll the setting with a retry-able
 * `cy.window().should(...)` rather than reading it once, letting the async
 * migration settle instead of racing it.

/**
 * The `0.9.0` step retires `system.docUrl`. Three things need a live
 * client: that the schema has really stopped accepting the field, that the
 * runner plans the registered step, and that the step's payload — a replacement
 * of the whole `system` object, which is what forces the stored record to be
 * rewritten from the pruned source — changes nothing else on the way through.
 *
 * The step is stamped at the release version, so on a pre-release build the
 * planner would skip it. These specs make the client report that version for the
 * duration of one run and drive the runner over the real registry, rather than
 * asserting that nothing happened; both the reported version and the stored one
 * are restored afterwards so the specs above keep their footing.
