/**
 * Offer-to-reschedule under the **Check/Test** split: a recurring
 * timed effect never auto-re-arms. The cycle has two halves, and only the second
 * one schedules anything:
 *
 * - a **`*Check`** _offers and does nothing else_ — it posts a card whose button
 *   invites the wound's controller to perform one test. No roll, no change, and
 *   **no schedule** (so a check firing cannot re-arm itself behind the player);
 * - a **`*Test`** _acts_ — it performs the effect and then OFFERS the next
 *   occurrence, anchored on the due time of the occurrence it just answered.
 *
 * Proven end to end against real Foundry, matching the two sanctioned ways to
 * answer a consent dialog:
 *
 * 1. **Headless, via the schedule scope (`scope.schedule`)** — the right tool when
 *    the offer is incidental to what a spec is setting up:
 *    - **accept** → the next healing check is armed on the generic
 *      `scheduledActions` store;
 *    - **decline** → the schedule is cleared, but the run record survives, so
 *      "when did this last happen?" is still answerable.
 *
 * The record follows the **act**: `system.lastRun` is stamped by the test that
 * performed, never by the check that merely offered.
 * 2. **By pressing the real dialog button** (`cy.submitDialog`) — modelling the
 *    player, for when the offer itself is the subject under test: clicking
 *    **Schedule** on the test's offer is what arms the next check.
