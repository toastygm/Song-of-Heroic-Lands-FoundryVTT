/**
 * The Assisted Combat tour: the second SohlTour after Character Creation.
 * It is single-actor and "pretend" throughout — no token, no scene, no turn order
 * — matching how Assisted Combat actually works. This spec asserts the tour
 * registers and lists, that its gated steps hold **Next** until the user acts
 * (weapon archetypes added, the bow held in both arms, a wound recorded, then a
 * second wound recorded), and that the underlying ATK and Impact actions post to
 * the chat log.
 *
 * Gate transitions are driven programmatically (the same document mutations the
 * user's sheet actions produce), then the tour's own Next-button gate state is
 * asserted — so the spec verifies the tour's gating/readState against the live
 * client without re-driving every dialog and drag.
