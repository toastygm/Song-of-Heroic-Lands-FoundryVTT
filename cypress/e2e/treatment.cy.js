/**
 * Action-card treatment flow, end to end.
 *
 * The three self-sufficient actions, driven through real posted cards: the
 * patient invokes **Request Treatment** on the wound
 * (`TraumaLogic.requestTreatment`), which posts an *open* Perform card; whoever
 * clicks it responds with their own `game.user.character` (the action self-gates
 * on the Physician skill) and posts a **Treatment Result** card whose Accept
 * button is targeted to the injury (owned by the patient); the patient's Accept
 * runs `TraumaLogic.treatInjury`, recording the Healing Rate. One GM-owned actor
 * plays both parts here. The proof: the wound's Healing Rate is recorded only
 * after the final Accept — nothing mutates until then. Each button carries
 * `data-skip-dialog`, so the card path runs the same action a human could run by
 * hand (which would open a dialog instead).
