/**
 * SoHL's guided-tour base class — the enabler for the **SoHL Guided Tours**
 * epic. Extends Foundry's NUE `Tour` to add three things a stock declarative
 * tour cannot do:
 *
 * 1. **Scene-setting navigation** — a step may {@link SohlTourStep.nav | open an
 *    Actor/Item sheet and switch to a named tab}, awaiting the render, so a
 *    selector that lives on a not-yet-open tab resolves after navigation. Only
 *    navigation is ever automated; the user's meaningful choices are never made
 *    for them (PRIME DIRECTIVE — assist, don't play the game).
 * 2. **Gated steps** — a **value gate** keeps **Next** disabled until a target
 *    control holds a required value; a **state gate** keeps it disabled until a
 *    predicate over document/DOM state passes. The *decision* is the Foundry-free
 *    {@link sohl.entity.tour} model; this class only reads the live sheet to
 *    feed it and toggles the button.
 * 3. **Re-render survival** — when the watched sheet re-renders between or during
 *    a step, the highlight/tooltip is re-anchored to the fresh target element.
 *
 * A free step (no gate) behaves exactly like a stock Foundry step.
 *
 * For a **driven** (railroaded) tour — the Automated Combat tour — it adds two
 * more capabilities, used only where the tour is meant to *perform* the workflow
 * rather than coach it:
 *
 * 4. **Drive steps** — a step's {@link SohlTourStep.drive | drive} actions
 *    (import an adventure, activate a scene, start/advance a combat, set a target)
 *    are performed and awaited before the step is shown, so the next step's
 *    targets exist. The ordering/await logic is the Foundry-free
 *    {@link sohl.entity.tour.runDrive}; this class only supplies the executor.
 * 5. **Seeded RNG** — with {@link SohlTourConfig.seedRng} set, {@link sohl.random}
 *    is seeded at tour start for reproducible scripted rolls and
 *    **guaranteed-restored on every exit path** (completion, abort, Escape,
 *    navigation, mid-step error) via a fire-once {@link sohl.entity.tour.RngLease}
 *    — the tour's one hard teardown obligation.
