 * that new players routinely miss:
 *
 * 1. **Assisted Combat is unopinionated.** No token, no scene, no initiative, no
 *    fixed order. ATK / BLK / CX / Impact / Resolve-Injury are each *independent*
 *    and runnable at any time, in or out of combat, in any order — the coherent
 *    path shown here is just *one* route through independent pieces.
 * 2. **The system rolls; it does not adjudicate.** After the rolls, the *players*
 *    read the opposed outcome off the **rulebook**. The tour's "pretend the
 *    broadsword hit" stands in for that human step — the deliberate opposite of
 *    the future Automated Combat tour, which automates the adjudication.
 * 3. **Consequences flow from the rolls without ceremony.** Impact derives from
 *    the attack roll; an injury can be created from an impact card — or from
 *    GM-given aspect + impact with no roll at all.
 *
 * Per the framework's step kinds, each step is **free** (advise/illustrate, advance
 * on Next) or **gated** (refuse to advance until the user has actually done the
 * thing). Gating is applied *only where a wrong choice would break the lesson*: the
 * weapon Gear archetypes, the bow-into-both-arms transition, and that a wound was
 * actually recorded. Everything else — the roll values, the manual adjudication,
 * the injury detail fields — is free. Nothing is ever performed on the user's
 * behalf beyond scene-setting navigation (PRIME DIRECTIVE — assist, don't play the
 * game).
 * @returns A ready-to-register {@link SohlTour} instance.
