/**
 * Build the SafeExpression editor's autocomplete source: every registered helper
 * function (inserted with its call parentheses) plus the identifiers the edited
 * field's {@link ExpressionScope} declares, each carrying its description.
 *
 * The scope is what makes the offered identifiers *right* rather than merely
 * plausible: it is the same declaration the runtime validates against, so
 * autocomplete cannot suggest a name that construction would reject. A
 * hand-typed list fed from a template attribute would have nothing tying it to
 * the evaluating call site.
 *
 * This is deliberately CodeMirror-runtime-free — it imports only the
 * `CompletionContext`/`CompletionResult` **types** — so it can be unit-tested in
 * Node without a browser. The editor module wires the returned source into
 * `autocompletion()`.
 *
 * @param scope - The edited field's declared scope, or `undefined` when the
 *   field declares none (only helpers are offered).
 * @returns A CodeMirror completion source.
