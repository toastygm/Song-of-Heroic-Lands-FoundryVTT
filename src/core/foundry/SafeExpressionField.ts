/**
 * A {@link foundry.data.fields.StringField} whose value is a
 * {@link SafeExpression} source string — a formula/predicate a GM authors (a
 * Skill's `skillBaseFormula`, an affliction's duration formula, and so on).
 *
 * It is a plain `StringField` on the wire — the value is still just the source
 * text. What it adds is a **semantic marker**: declaring a field as a
 * `SafeExpressionField` is how a sheet knows the field holds an expression and
 * warrants the SafeExpression **code editor** (an edit button that opens
 * `openExpressionEditorDialog`) rather than a bare text input.
 *
 * **It deliberately does _not_ reject an invalid expression at the schema
 * boundary.** By design a malformed formula is *stored* and *surfaced as a
 * warning* by the consuming logic (e.g. `SkillLogic.computeSkillBase` renders a
 * ✕ and an "Invalid expression" hint), so authors can save work-in-progress and
 * fix it later — hard schema rejection would discard it and break that flow. The
 * authoritative validity check ({@link SafeExpression.validateSource}) runs
 * **live in the editor**, where Save stays disabled until the expression is
 * valid.
 *
 * ## Using it
 *
 * Declare it in `defineSchema()` like any other field, naming the
 * {@link sohl.entity.expr.ExpressionScope} its value will be evaluated against:
 *
 * ```ts
 * static override defineSchema(): PlainObject {
 *     return {
 *         ...super.defineSchema(),
 *         // Evaluated by SkillLogic.computeSkillBase against `attr`.
 *         skillBaseFormula: new SafeExpressionField({ scope: "skill.base" }),
 *     };
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Render it with the shared `expressionField` Handlebars partial, which draws
 * the `formGroup` plus the editor button and forwards the declared scope as
 * `data-expr-scope` — the sheet needs no per-field wiring:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * {{> expressionField field=fields.skillBaseFormula
 *     rootId="skill-sbf" name="system.skillBaseFormula"
 *     value=system.skillBaseFormula}}
 * ```
 *
 * Then evaluate the stored source against the *same* scope, so what the editor
 * accepted is exactly what the runtime allows:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const scope = expressionScopes.require("skill.base");
 * const expr = new SafeExpression({ source }, { parent: this, scope });
 * const value = expr.evaluate(scope.bind({ attr: this.buildAttrContext() }));
 * ```
 *
 * ## Options
 *
 * Every {@link foundry.data.fields.StringField} option is accepted (see
 * {@link SafeExpressionField.Options}); `scope` is the only one this class adds.
 *
 * | Option | Default here | Notes |
 * | ------ | ------------ | ----- |
 * | `scope` | _none_ | Id of the {@link sohl.entity.expr.ExpressionScope} the value is evaluated against. Optional, but omitting it means no identifier checking and no editor autocomplete — declare it unless the field genuinely has no fixed call site. Resolved eagerly, so an unknown id throws at schema construction. |
 * | `nullable` | `true` | Changed from `StringField`'s `false`: "unset" is `null`, per the null-at-the-edges convention. |
 * | `blank` | `false` | Changed from `StringField`'s `true`, so a cleared editor or form input cleans to `null` rather than leaving a second "empty" spelling (`""`). |
 * | `initial` | `null` | Unset by default; set it explicitly if a field ships with a formula. |
 * | `trim` | `true` | Same as `StringField` — restated because surrounding whitespace is never meaningful in an expression. |
 *
 * Only `nullable`, `blank`, and `initial` actually differ from `StringField`;
 * everything else (`required`, `label`, `hint`, `choices`, `validate`, …)
 * behaves exactly as it does there. Override any of them per field — but think
 * twice before reverting `nullable`/`blank`, since that pair is what keeps "no
 * formula" a single value instead of two. Both shipped fields
 * (`SkillDataModel.skillBaseFormula`, `AfflictionDataModel.outcomeTraumas`) pass
 * nothing but `scope`.
 *
 * The scope is what lets the *schema* tell the sheet which identifiers a formula
 * may use, so the editor's autocomplete and live validation match the call site
 * that actually evaluates it. Before scopes, the sheet template carried a
 * hand-typed `data-context="attr"` string with nothing tying it to the
 * evaluating code (issue #1142).
