 * ── Construction indirection: base class ───────────────────────────────
 * Registered entity classes are constructed through the registry so a variant
 * module can override them. Inside SoHL that means `import { entity }` then
 * `new entity.X(...)`; outside SoHL it is `new sohl.entity.X(...)`.
 *
 * OpposedTestResult is a BASE class of another registered class (CombatResult),
 * so it imports the registry from the cycle-free leaf `@src/entity/entityRegistry`
 * (never the `registry.ts` barrel, which eagerly loads the subclass tree and
 * would evaluate `class CombatResult extends OpposedTestResult` mid-load →
 * `TypeError: Class extends value undefined`). The bare side-effect import above
 * guarantees SuccessTestResult self-registers so `entity.SuccessTestResult`
 * resolves even in a bare unit test. See the "Entity class registry" section of
 * kb/dev-docs/reference/runtime-contracts.md.

/**
 * The result of an **opposed test** — two actors directly competing via
 * their respective {@link SuccessTestResult | success tests}.
 *
 * Opposed tests are used for contested actions: grappling, stealth vs.
 * perception, persuasion vs. will, and similar skill-vs-skill situations.
 * Each side performs a success test independently, and the results are
 * compared to determine the winner.
 *
 * ## Resolution
 *
 * - {@link sourceTestResult} — the initiating actor's success test
 * - {@link targetTestResult} — the responding actor's success test
 * - Winner determined by comparing success levels, with configurable
 *   tie-breaking rules ({@link tieBreak}, {@link breakTies}).
 *
 * ## Key properties
 *
 * - {@link sourceWins} / {@link targetWins} — outcome flags
 * - {@link isTied} — both sides achieved the same success level
 * - {@link bothFail} — neither side succeeded
 *
 * ## Two-phase execution
 *
 * Opposed tests are executed in two phases:
 * 1. {@link sohl.entity.modifier.MasteryLevelModifier.opposedTestStart} — source rolls and
 *    result is posted to chat with a "respond" button.
 * 2. {@link sohl.entity.modifier.MasteryLevelModifier.opposedTestResume} — target rolls and
 *    the opposed outcome is evaluated and posted.
 *
 * ## Subclass
 *
 * {@link CombatResult} extends this for full combat resolution (attack
 * vs. defense with damage calculation).
