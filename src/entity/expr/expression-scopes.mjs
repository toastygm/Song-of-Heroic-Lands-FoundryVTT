/**
 * The catalog of **expression scopes** — for every place SoHL evaluates a
 * {@link SafeExpression}, the exact set of identifiers an author may write
 * there, each with the description shown in the editor's autocomplete.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth behind three surfaces that would
 * otherwise each carry their own copy of the same fact:
 *
 * 1. **Validation** — `SafeExpression` rejects an identifier outside the
 *    declared scope at *construction*, so a typo fails loudly where it is
 *    authored instead of silently at every evaluation.
 * 2. **The editor** — autocomplete offers exactly these identifiers, with these
 *    descriptions, and live validation flags an out-of-scope one while typing.
 * 3. **The documentation** — the bound-variables table in
 *    `kb/dev-docs/concepts/expressions.md` is generated from this catalog by
 *    `utils/build-expression-scopes-doc.mjs` and guarded by `npm run lint`.
 *
 * This module is deliberately **plain ESM** — no TypeScript, no `@src` aliases,
 * no Foundry — precisely so the plain-`node` documentation scripts *and* the
 * bundled TS runtime can both import it (the same arrangement as
 * `@heroiclands/package-build/sohl/default-item-art`). A `.ts` module could not
 * be required by
 * the doc scripts, which run under bare `node`.
 *
 * ## Adding a scope
 *
 * Add an entry here, then pass the scope at the `new SafeExpression(...)` call
 * site (`{ parent, scope: expressionScopes.get("<id>") }`). Regenerate the docs
 * with `npm run docs:expr-scopes`. There is no separate registration step —
 * this object *is* the registry.
 *
 * ### Entry shape
 *
 * - `label` — a short human name, used as the docs-table row title.
 * - `site` — where the expression is authored, for the docs table.
 * - `field` — the data field(s) the scope applies to, for the docs table.
 * - `result` — what the expression is expected to evaluate to.
 * - `summary` — one sentence of prose about when this scope applies.
 * - `open` — when `true`, identifiers beyond those declared are **permitted**.
 *   Reserve this for genuinely dynamic contexts (see `event.predicate`); the
 *   declared bindings are then documentation and autocomplete only, not a gate.
 * - `bindings` — identifier name → description. May be empty, which means the
 *   expression may use **only** literals and helper calls.
 *
 * @module expression-scopes

/**
 * Every expression scope, keyed by its stable id. Ids are dotted
