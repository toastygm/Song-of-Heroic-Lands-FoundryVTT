/**
 * A parsed, validated, reusable safe expression — SoHL's way to evaluate a
 * condition that was written as a *string* (for example, a predicate a GM types
 * into an action's `trigger` field, or an Active Effect's `test`) without the
 * dangers of `eval`.
 *
 * It exists because such strings come from data, not source code: they must be
 * evaluated against live game objects, yet must never be able to run arbitrary
 * code, reach the DOM or network, or escape through the prototype chain.
 * `SafeExpression` parses the string into a syntax tree, **statically validates**
 * it against a strict allowlist, then evaluates that tree by hand. Anything
 * outside the allowed language is rejected — usually before it ever runs.
 *
 * It is a {@link SohlEntity}: only its {@link source} is persisted (via
 * {@link toJSON}); the parsed AST is rebuilt in the constructor on revival.
 *
 * For a hands-on authoring guide — the grammar, the full standard-helper
 * reference (exact signatures and return values), the bindings each call site
 * provides, and worked examples — see the
 * [Expressions and Scripts](https://www.heroiclands.org/sohl/kb/dev-docs/concepts/expressions/) concept doc.
 * The summary below covers the essentials.
 *
 * ## Using it
 *
 * Two steps: build once, then evaluate as often as you like.
 *
 * 1. **Construct** — `new SafeExpression({ source }, { parent })` parses and
 *    validates `source` immediately. If the string uses anything unsupported it
 *    throws a {@link SafeExpressionError} right here, so a bad predicate fails
 *    loudly at setup time instead of silently at use time. Construction is the
 *    costly step; keep the instance and reuse it.
 * 2. **Evaluate** — `expr.evaluate(context?)` runs the expression against
 *    `context`, a plain object of variable bindings. Every bare identifier in the
 *    expression is looked up by name in `context`. It returns whatever the
 *    expression computes (for a predicate, a boolean; for a computed field, a
 *    number or string).
 *
 * ```ts
 * // A simple predicate. `level` and `injured` are read from the context object.
 * const expr = new SafeExpression({ source: "level >= 3 && !injured" }, { parent });
 * expr.evaluate({ level: 5, injured: false }); // true
 * expr.evaluate({ level: 2, injured: false }); // false
 * expr.evaluate({ level: 9, injured: true });  // false
 * ```
 *
 * ## Scopes — declaring what is in play
 *
 * An expression's identifiers only mean something against the bindings its call
 * site supplies, and that contract used to be implicit: each site built an
 * ad-hoc object literal, so writing an identifier the site did not bind parsed
 * cleanly and only threw at evaluation — where the caller caught it, logged a
 * warning, and silently treated the feature as off.
 *
 * Pass an {@link ExpressionScope} to close that gap. The scope declares the
 * legal identifiers, and construction rejects anything outside them:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const scope = expressionScopes.require("skill.base");
 * new SafeExpression({ source: "sb(strength)" }, { parent, scope });
 * // ✗ throws: Unknown identifier "strength" in the "skill.base" scope;
 * //           available identifiers: attr
 * ```
 *
 * Only the **root** identifier of a member chain is checked — `itemLogic.foo.bar`
 * validates `itemLogic` and leaves the object graph alone, since the roots are a
 * knowable list and the graph is not. The scope is optional: an expression built
 * without one accepts any identifier and resolves it from the evaluation context,
 * exactly as before.
 *
 * ## The language
 *
 * **Allowed:** literals (`3`, `"orc"`, `true`), array literals (`[1, 2]`),
 * identifiers resolved from the context, property access by dot or bracket
 * (`actor.name`, `tags["ranged"]`), the operators `=== !== < > <= >= + - * / %`,
 * the short-circuiting `&&` and `||`, the unary `! - +`, the ternary
 * `cond ? a : b`, and calls to **helpers** (below).
 *
 * **Rejected — at parse/validation time, before anything runs:** assignment
 * (`=`), bitwise and loose-equality operators (`& | == !=`), `typeof` / `new` /
 * `delete` / `instanceof`, statements (`;`, `if`, `for`), template and regex
 * literals, and — importantly — **method calls**. You cannot write `actor.die()`;
 * the only callable values are the registered helpers.
 *
 * ## Helpers
 *
 * Because method calls are banned, **helpers** are how you expose behavior to an
 * expression. They come from the global {@link expressionHelpers} registry — the
 * built-in library plus any world-loaded custom helpers — and are resolved by
 * name when the expression is validated and evaluated.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // `has` and `len` are built-in helpers; the expression may call them by name.
 * const expr = new SafeExpression(
 *     { source: "has('ranged', tags) && len(tags) <= 3" },
 *     { parent },
 * );
 * expr.evaluate({ tags: ["ranged", "magic"] }); // true
 * ```
 *
 * ## Errors
 *
 * Every failure — a parse error, an unsupported node, an unknown identifier at
 * evaluation, or an attempt to extract a method — surfaces as a
 * {@link SafeExpressionError}. Syntax and validation failures throw from the
 * constructor; runtime failures throw from {@link evaluate}.
 *
 * @see {@link SafeExpressionError} — the single error type every failure uses.
 * @see {@link expressionHelpers} — the global helper registry.
