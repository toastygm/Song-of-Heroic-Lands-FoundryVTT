/**
 * Governing mastery level — the pure, Foundry-free derivation of a strike
 * mode's Atk/Blk/CX rolls from the mastery level of the skill that governs it.
 *
 * A strike mode's own `attack`/`block`/`counterstrike` modifiers carry only its
 * flat Atk/Blk/CX deltas; the mastery level that makes them non-zero comes from
 * the governing skill. Both wielders of strike modes fold it in the same way:
 * a **weapon** (`WeaponGearLogic`) resolves the governing skill from each strike
 * mode's `assocSkillCode`, and a **combat technique** (`SkillLogic`) uses its own
 * mastery level (or an `assocSkillCode` override). The owning logic decides
 * *which* mastery level governs; this helper applies it.
