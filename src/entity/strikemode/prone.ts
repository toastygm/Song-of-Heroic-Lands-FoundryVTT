/**
 * Prone combat effects — the pure, Foundry-free application of the prone
 * penalty to a melee strike mode.
 *
 * A prone being suffers **−20 to all melee attacks and defenses** (Prone rules,
 * `assets/content/Rules/Prone.md`). This module applies that penalty to a
 * {@link sohl.entity.strikemode.MeleeStrikeMode}'s attack and both defense
 * modifiers; the owning logic decides *when* to call it (when the wielder carries
 * the `prone` status), mirroring how body reach is folded into a melee mode.
 *
 * The remaining prone effects — Engagement-Zone, body-part-selection, and
 * Outnumbered interactions, and the quarter-Move cost to rise — live with those
 * subsystems and are not applied here.
