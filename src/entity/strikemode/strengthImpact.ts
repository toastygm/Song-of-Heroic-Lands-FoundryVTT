/**
 * The **Strength Impact Modifier** — the pure, Foundry-free rule that a
 * strong combatant drives a weapon harder than a weak one.
 *
 * The rule is published as a lookup table (STR 1 → −10, rising to STR 24–25 →
 * +7, "increases by 1 every two STR above 24"). SoHL computes it instead, so it
 * extends without limit in both directions: the system carries creatures from
 * STR 1 insects to colossi well past the printed table's end, and a table would
 * simply run out.
 *
 * The closed form is two segments:
 *
 * | Strength | Modifier          | Shape                          |
 * | -------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
 * | ≥ 5      | `⌊(STR − 10) / 2⌋` | +1 per two points, unbounded  |
 * | ≤ 4      | `2 × STR − 12`     | −2 per point, the steep tail  |
 *
 * Both segments reproduce every printed row exactly, and they meet cleanly at
 * the seam (STR 4 → −4, STR 5 → −3). The steep low tail is the published
 * table's own shape: below STR 5 a combatant loses ground far faster, because
 * at that point they can barely drive the weapon at all.
 *
 * **Applies to melee attacks and thrown weapons only.** Bows, crossbows and
 * slings get no benefit — their impact comes from the launcher, not the arm —
 * and a strike mode carrying the `noStrMod` trait is excluded outright.
 *
 * Two reductions ride on top, and they stack:
 *
 * - **Off-hand** — the weapon is gripped only by limbs on the combatant's
 *   non-dominant side. Dominance is read from the Left/Right Dominance
 *   characteristics; see {@link sohl.document.actor.logic.BeingLogic.dominantSide}.
 * - **Thrown** — the weapon is itself the projectile.
