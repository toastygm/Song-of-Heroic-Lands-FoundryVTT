/**
 * An executable **action** attached to a document (an actor or item) and
 * surfaced as an entry on that document's **context menu** (and on chat-card
 * buttons). Choosing the entry runs the action.
 *
 * A **Script action** is, in effect, a _macro attached to a document_: instead of
 * sitting on the macro bar it lives on a specific actor or item and runs with that
 * document as its context. An **intrinsic action** (below) is the same thing
 * authored in code rather than typed by a GM.
 *
 * Actions are how a character or item *does* something — run a skill test, make
 * an attack, activate a mystical ability. They come in two flavors that differ
 * only in where the executor comes from:
 *
 * - **Intrinsic actions** — defined in code by Logic classes via
 *   `defineIntrinsicActions()`. The `executor` is the *name of a method* on the
 *   scoped target logic (e.g. `successTest` on a Skill), looked up and bound at
 *   construction. This is how the system ships its built-in actions.
 * - **Script actions** — GM-authored. The `executor` is the **UUID of a
 *   Foundry `Macro`**; running the action invokes `Macro#execute` (which
 *   enforces the `MACRO_SCRIPT` permission and ownership) with a
 *   {@link SohlActionContext}-derived scope. No code is stored on, or compiled
 *   from, the document — see the security model's "reference code, never
 *   compile it" rule. Stored per-document and permission-gated; there is no
 *   end-user authoring UI.
 *
 * Either way, an action carries:
 * - a **scope** (`SELF` / `ITEM` / `ACTOR`) selecting which logic the executor
 *   binds to — i.e. what `this` is when it runs (the action's own logic, the
 *   owning item's, or the owning actor's);
 * - a {@link trigger} predicate (availability) and a {@link visible} predicate
 *   (UI display), each authored as a {@link sohl.entity.expr.SafeExpression} string;
 * - an {@link executor} that performs the work.
 *
 * The constructor compiles `trigger`/`visible` and resolves/binds `executor`
 * from their stored string forms, so a finished `SohlAction` is ready to
 * {@link execute}. See {@link sohl.core.logic.SohlLogic.getContextOptions} for how actions become
 * context-menu entries.
 *
 * A Script action's Macro is an ordinary Foundry script Macro, so it can use
 * the full client API (`actor`, `token`, and the SoHL `sohl`/`.logic` surfaces
 * are passed in scope). If the behavior outgrows a single Macro, reach for a
 * Foundry **module** instead.
 *
 * @example
 * // An intrinsic action definition (from a Logic class's
 * // defineIntrinsicActions): the executor is the name of a method on the
 * // scoped target logic, bound at construction.
 * { subType: "intrinsic", scope: "self", executor: "successTest", trigger: "true" }
 *
 * @example
 * // A Script action references a GM-authored Macro by UUID; the Macro body is
 * // where the GM's code lives (never on the action).
 * { subType: "script", scope: "actor", executor: "Macro.p8f2c1a0d9e7b6a5" }

/**
 * Compile an action's `visible` source string into a predicate. The
 * predicate is the UI gate: a context-menu entry for the action shows iff
 * `visible(element)` returns truthy.
 *
 * **Composition.** Visibility is `visibleSource AND scriptPermission AND
 * trigger`:
 *
 * 1. The visibility source is evaluated as a SafeExpression against the
 *    `action.visible` {@link sohl.entity.expr.ExpressionScope} — `element`,
 *    `itemLogic`, `actorLogic`, and `isGM`. The two logic bindings are
 *    `undefined` when nothing of that kind surrounds the element. If the
 *    expression is false, the action is hidden.
 * 2. For `SCRIPT` subtypes, the current user must satisfy
 *    `data.minActorOwnership` against the surrounding actor (see
 *    {@link userMeetsExecutePermission}). This mirrors `execute()`'s
 *    hard gate so unauthorized scripted actions don't appear in the
 *    menu only to be no-op'd on click.
 * 3. Finally `trigger(item, actor)` must return truthy.
 *
 * Any UI surface that consults visibility therefore reflects both
 * domain availability and execution permission without duplication.
 *
 * Parse and evaluation errors are caught and logged; the action is
 * treated as hidden rather than allowed to bubble.
 * @param data - The full action data; used for source, title, subType, and
 *   `minActorOwnership`.
 * @param trigger - The compiled trigger predicate to compose with.
 * @param parent - The owning action's logic, used as the expression's parent.
 * @returns A visibility predicate.
