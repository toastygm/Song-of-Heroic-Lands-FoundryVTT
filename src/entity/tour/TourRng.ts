/**
 * The seeded-roll lifecycle for a **driven** tour — the Foundry-free half of the
 * `SohlTour` deterministic-RNG capability.
 *
 * A driven tour (the Automated Combat tour) is railroaded: it performs a fixed
 * sequence of actions whose scripted rolls must come out the same every run. To
 * make that so it seeds the process-wide {@link sohl.entity.random.Rng}
 * ({@link sohl.random}) at tour start — but a seeded shared stream is *dangerous*
 * left in place: it would make the user's real game return identical dice until
 * reload. So the seed comes as a **lease** whose {@link RngLease.restore | restore}
 * puts the exact pre-tour stream position back, and which the tour is obliged to
 * invoke on *every* exit path.
 *
 * This module owns only the pure seed/snapshot/restore mechanics against an
 * {@link sohl.entity.random.Rng}; the Foundry-coupled `SohlTour` owns *when*
 * restore fires (completion, abort, Escape, navigation, mid-step error). Keeping
 * the mechanics here lets the reproducibility and the fire-once guarantee be
 * unit-tested without a running Foundry (`tests/domain/tour/TourRng.test.ts`).
 */

/**
 * A one-shot handle over a seeded {@link sohl.entity.random.Rng} stream. Created
 * by {@link seedRngForTour}, which has already snapshotted the pre-seed state and
 * applied the seed; the sole obligation is to call {@link restore} — from *any*
 * tour-exit path — to return the stream to normal. {@link restore} is
 * **fire-once and idempotent**, so wiring it into several redundant exit hooks
 * (the safety net the tour needs) is safe: the second and later calls no-op.
