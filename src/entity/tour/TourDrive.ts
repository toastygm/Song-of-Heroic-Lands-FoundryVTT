/**
 * The **drive** step vocabulary for a railroaded tour — the Foundry-free half of
 * the `SohlTour` drive-primitives capability.
 *
 * A coach-and-wait tour only ever automates *scene-setting* navigation and
 * otherwise waits for the human (the PRIME DIRECTIVE). The **Automated Combat**
 * tour is different: it is opinionated and railroaded, so a step may *perform* an
 * action rather than wait for one — import an adventure, activate a scene, start
 * and advance a combat, set a target. This is sanctioned precisely because such a
 * tour demonstrates the automation end-to-end down a fixed path; it is never the
 * general tour behaviour.
 *
 * These descriptors are **pure data**: they name *what* to do, not *how*. The
 * Foundry-coupled `SohlTour` supplies the executor that turns each descriptor into
 * Foundry calls. That split keeps the drive **sequencing** — run each action in
 * order, await it fully before the next so the following step's targets exist —
 * Foundry-free and unit-tested (`tests/domain/tour/TourDrive.test.ts`), while the
 * side-effecting primitives live where Foundry does.
 */

 * The kinds of drive action a step can perform. Each is executed by `SohlTour`'s
