/**
 * Body-part impairment derivation.
 *
 * A body part's impairment is the penalty applied to any use of it, caused by
 * wounds and easing as they heal. A part takes the **most serious** injury among
 * its hit locations:
 *
 * - a **grievous** injury (level ≥ 4, `G4`/`G5`) makes the part **unusable**;
 * - a **serious** injury (level 2–3, `S2`/`S3`) impairs it by **−10**;
 * - a **minor** injury (level 1, `M1`) impairs it by **−5**, but only while it is
 *   slow to heal (healing rate ≤ 5);
 *
 * and as injuries heal the part climbs back unusable → −10 → −5 → none. A
 * **permanent impairment** (a non-positive floor, e.g. an old maiming) is a
 * minimum the result can never be milder than.
 *
 * Pure and Foundry-free; consumed by the Being-sheet header grid (and, later, the
 * health derivation #463).
