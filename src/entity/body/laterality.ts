/**
 * **Body laterality and side dominance** — which side of a body a part
 * is on, which side a being favors, and whether a given grip is the off hand.
 *
 * This is the single home for the dominance question. It comes up wherever a
 * favored side makes a difference — the off-hand impact reduction is only the
 * first caller — so the rule is defined once here rather than restated at each
 * site.
 *
 * **A being's dominant side is read from its characteristics**, not from a flag
 * on a limb:
 *
 * - Left Dominance alone → the left side is dominant.
 * - Right Dominance alone → the right side is dominant.
 * - **Both, or neither → no dominant side.** An ambidextrous being has no off
 *   hand, and so never suffers an off-hand penalty.
 *
 * **A part's side is derived from its shortcode**, which is guaranteed present
 * and stable, rather than from its display name (which is prose, and
 * localizable). A part is lateral when its shortcode begins with `l` or `r`
 * **and the mirrored shortcode also exists on that body** — `larmpart` is left
 * because `rarmpart` is there beside it. Requiring the twin is what keeps the
 * prefix from misreading a central organ: a lone `liverpart` has no `riverpart`,
 * so it correctly has no side.
