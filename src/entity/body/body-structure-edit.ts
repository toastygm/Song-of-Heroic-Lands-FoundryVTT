/**
 * Move one element of a **flat, parent-referencing** array — either reordering
 * it among its current siblings or re-parenting it to another group — and
 * return a new array.
 *
 * Since `body.structure` stores zones, parts, and locations as flat sibling
 * arrays, a child's position "within its parent" is just its relative order
 * among the array elements sharing that parent code. Moving it therefore means
 * splicing it to the flat slot currently occupied by the destination group's
 * `toPosition`-th member, after re-stamping its parent code.
 *
 * Placement rules:
 * - `toPosition` past the destination group's end inserts after its last member.
 * - A destination group with no members appends to the end of the array.
 * - An out-of-range `fromIndex` returns an unchanged copy.
 *
 * Never mutates the input.
 *
 * @typeParam T - The persisted element shape.
 * @param items - The source flat array (not mutated).
 * @param fromIndex - Index of the element to move.
 * @param toGroup - Parent code of the destination group (its current parent for
 *   a plain reorder).
 * @param toPosition - Target position among the destination group's members,
 *   counted **after** the element has been removed.
 * @param getGroup - Reads an element's parent code.
 * @param setGroup - Returns a copy of an element stamped with a new parent code.
 * @returns A new array with the element moved (and re-parented if needed).
