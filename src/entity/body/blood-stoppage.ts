/**
 * Blood Stoppage — the pure, Foundry-free outcome of a **Blood Stoppage
 * Test** (a Physician skill test on a bleeding injury).
 *
 * A physician may answer a bleeder's request and roll a Blood Stoppage Test; the
 * result (Bleeding rules, `assets/content/Rules/Bleeding.md`) is relayed back to
 * the bleeding injury: `CF` continues, `MF` continues with **+10** to the next
 * test, `MS` stops the bleeding after the next Blood Loss Advance, and `CS` stops
 * it immediately. If no physician accepts by the end of the round, the Blood Loss
 * Advance proceeds as though the Stoppage Test were a Critical Failure — the
 * auto-resolve fallback already delivered by #487.
