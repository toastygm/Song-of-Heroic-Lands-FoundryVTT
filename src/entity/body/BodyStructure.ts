/**
 * The complete anatomical structure of a Being — its zones, body parts, and
 * hit locations.
 *
 * **Storage is flat; the hierarchy is derived.** The persisted data holds three
 * sibling arrays — {@link BodyStructure.Data.zones | zones},
 * {@link BodyStructure.Data.parts | parts}, and
 * {@link BodyStructure.Data.locations | locations} — where each child names its
 * parent by shortcode (`bodyZoneCode` / `bodyPartCode`). The constructor
 * assembles them into the Zone → Part → Location tree exposed by
 * {@link BodyStructure.zones}. Flat storage keeps every `update()` a
 * single whole-array write (see {@link setPartFieldsUpdate}) instead of
 * the nested rewrite a tree would force.
 *
 * Every entity's `index` is its position in its **flat** array, so
 * `structure.parts[i].index === i` and each `updatePath` is a plain two-segment
 * path. Position *within* a parent is the child's relative order in the flat
 * array.
 *
 * **Hit determination** runs top down: each zone owns a contiguous run of zone
 * numbers sized by its weight — contiguous and gap-free across the body, so
 * they run `1..`{@link maxZoneNumber} — and one roll against that range picks a
 * zone ({@link getRandomZone}), then a weighted part inside it, then a weighted
 * location.
 *
 * **Lifecycle:** This object is rebuilt from persisted schema data on every
 * preparation cycle. It may be mutated during the lifecycle (e.g., active
 * effects adding ValueModifier deltas to protection values), but those
 * changes are not persisted — they are recomputed on the next cycle.
 * To persist changes, modify the underlying DataModel fields directly
 * (via form submission or `document.update()`).
