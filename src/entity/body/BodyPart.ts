/**
 * A body part containing one or more {@link BodyLocation | hit locations} —
 * e.g., "Head" (containing Skull, Face), "Left Arm" (containing Upper Arm,
 * Elbow, Forearm, Hand).
 *
 * Each part is tagged with one or more `BodyRole`s describing which
 * functional roles it fulfills (VITAL, CORE, MANIPULATOR, LOCOMOTOR). Skills
 * and attributes declare which roles impair them; injury at a part impairs
 * every skill/attribute that lists any of the part's roles. Mishap behavior
 * (fumble/stumble checks) is also role-driven; see BodyRole in constants.
 *
 * **Persistence:** parts are stored in the flat `body.structure.parts` array
 * and declare their owning zone via {@link BodyPart.Data.bodyZoneCode}. A part
 * does *not* nest its locations — locations name their part via
 * {@link sohl.entity.body.BodyLocation.Data.bodyPartCode}, and
 * {@link BodyStructure} assembles the hierarchy at construction.
 *
 * **Lifecycle:** Rebuilt from persisted schema data on every preparation
 * cycle. May be mutated during the lifecycle (e.g., modifiers applied by
 * active effects), but mutations are not persisted — they are recomputed
 * on the next cycle.
