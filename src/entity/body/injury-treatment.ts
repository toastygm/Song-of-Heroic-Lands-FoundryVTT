/**
 * Injury Treatment tables — the Physician **Treatment Test** and its
 * consequences, as pure, Foundry-free lookups over the tables in the Injury
 * rules (`https://www.heroiclands.org/sohl/kb/dev-docs/` → Injury → _Injury Treatment_).
 *
 * A new injury is untreated; treatment establishes its
 * {@link sohl.document.item.logic.TraumaData.healingRateBase | Healing Rate}
 * (which then governs {@link sohl.document.item.logic.TraumaLogic.healingCheck |
 * Injury Healing Tests}). The Physician test's result and the wound's
 * severity band select the Healing Rate; the wound's aspect and severity select
 * the required treatment action and its difficulty; and the resulting Healing
 * Rate (with the aspect) determines the special injury effects — bleeders and
 * permanent-impairment eligibility.
 *
 * @remarks The `Frost` and `Projectile` (incl. broad-head) aspects and the
 *   amputation-for-grievous-frost path described in the rules have no
 *   representation in the current {@link sohl.utils.ImpactAspect} enum
 *   (`blunt`/`edged`/`piercing`/`fire`), so {@link requiredTreatment} covers only
 *   those four aspects; the remainder await an aspect-model extension.
