 * Repair a `shortcode` that is not strictly alphanumeric.

 * would carry a document it could no longer save. Three shipped content notes
 * had one (`trauma:self-pro`, `trauma:self-suf`, `weapongear:B&CFl`), and any
 * world that imported them holds copies keyed by identity, as may any
 * hand-authored or third-party document.
 *
 * The repair strips the offending characters and folds the result to lowercase,
 * which maps each of the three to exactly the replacement its content note now
 * carries (`selfpro`, `selfsuf`, `bcfl`), so a world copy and its compendium
 * origin stay the same entity. When nothing alphanumeric survives, the key is
 * derived from the document name instead; when even that is empty the shortcode
 * is left alone — there is nothing to derive from, and a random id would sever
 * the identity rather than preserve it.
 *
 * **It also folds case.** The rule now requires lowercase, so this step
 * additionally rewrites every mixed-case key a pre-0.9 world holds — `Clb` →
 * `clb`. That is a canonical respelling rather than a change of identity: the
 * address and the document `_id` derived from a shortcode were already
 * lowercased, so the two spellings always denoted one entity. Folding here is
 * what makes the repair *converge*; a case-preserving repair would hand the
 * guard back the same value it had just refused.
 *
 * A blank or absent shortcode is likewise left alone: filling one in is the
 * create/update guard's job, and it holds a scope-aware taken-set this migrator
 * cannot see. For the same reason the repair does not check uniqueness — the
 * three renames collide with nothing, and the guard resolves any collision the
 * next time the document is written.
