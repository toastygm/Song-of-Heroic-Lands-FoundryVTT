/**
 * Archetype discovery — the Foundry-free core of the Create-dialog archetype
 * picker.
 *
 * An **archetype** is an existing Actor/Item document marked as a starting
 * template (`system.templatePriority = <priority:number>`) that the Create
 * dialog offers to clone from, so a new being/item is
 * born fully populated instead of blank. This module holds the pure rules — no Foundry
 * access — that turn a flat list of discovered candidates into the picker's
 * option list:
 * filter by the current `(type, subType)` selection, **dedup by shortcode**
 * (the shortcode is an archetype's stable identity; the name is presentation
 * and may diverge or be localized), and pick a **winner** per shortcode by the
 * composite ordering _priority desc, then source tier asc, then a stable UUID_.
 *
 * The Foundry boundary that gathers candidates (world documents + compendium
 * packs) lives in `FoundryHelpers.ts` (`fvttDiscoverArchetypes`); it hands this
 * module plain records so all of the interesting logic is unit-testable in Node.
 *
 * @see https://www.heroiclands.org/sohl/kb/dev-docs/how-to/extension-points/
