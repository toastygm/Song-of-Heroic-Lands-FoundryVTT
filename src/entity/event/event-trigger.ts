/**
 * SoHL trigger taxonomy.
 *
 * The trigger vocabulary is intentionally identical to Foundry's
 * `CONFIG.ActiveEffect.expiryEvents` registry so that an Active Effect
 * with `duration.expiry === "turnStart"` and a SoHL subscription on
 * `"turnStart"` are responding to the same moment, in the same shape,
 * with the same data.
 *
 * Built-in trigger names and their context payloads mirror the calls
 * Foundry itself makes to `ActiveEffect.registry.refresh(name, ctx)`
 * (see `client/helpers/time.mjs` and `client/documents/combat.mjs` in
 * the Foundry source).
 *
 * Two dispatchers exist (Foundry's `ActiveEffect.registry` and SoHL's
 * `SohlEventQueue`), but there is **one taxonomy**.
