/**
 * **Scene-region trigger vocabulary** — the curated set of Foundry
 * v14 scene-region events SoHL bridges into its {@link SohlEventQueue | event
 * queue}, and the SoHL trigger names they arrive under.
 *
 * Region events are the archetypal **event-driven** trigger: their timing is a
 * function of player movement, so there is no `fireAt` and
 * {@link sohl.entity.event.SohlEventQueue.nextFireTime | nextFireTime} is
 * `undefined` by design (the queryable temporal fact is the *last* occurrence,
 * `system.lastRun` — see the Event Queue reference). This module is the pure,
 * Foundry-free half: the map is data, and the bridge that consumes it (a SoHL
 * `RegionBehaviorType` subtype) lives in the Foundry layer.
 *
 * **Curation.** Foundry fires a much richer event set than SoHL exposes.
 * Continuous / view-dependent streams (`tokenMove*`, `tokenAnimate*`) would
 * flood the queue, and the behavior-lifecycle / boundary events
 * (`behavior*`, `regionBoundary`) are internal plumbing, not player-facing
 * moments — all are deliberately {@link EXCLUDED_REGION_EVENTS | excluded}. The
 * exposed set is the discrete, meaningful events: a token entering/exiting a
 * region, and a token taking its combat turn/round while inside one.
 *
 * @module RegionTriggers
