/**
 * In-memory trigger dispatcher for SoHL.
 *
 * Accessible at runtime as `sohl.events`.
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * Documents subscribe to **triggers** — named lifecycle moments shared
 * with Foundry's `CONFIG.ActiveEffect.expiryEvents` vocabulary
 * (`updateWorldTime`, `combatStart`, `combatEnd`, `roundStart`,
 * `roundEnd`, `turnStart`, `turnEnd`, plus any custom names registered
 * via `registerSohlTrigger`). When a trigger fires, matching subscriptions
 * dispatch by **executing the action** named by the subscription's `actionName` on the
 * owning document's logic — the trigger context (with the subscription's
 * `payload`) becomes the action's scope. An event therefore reuses the very
 * same action a user could invoke manually.
 *
 * Time scheduling is one trigger among many: a `scheduleAt(uuid, actionName,
 * fireAt, payload)` call creates a one-shot subscription on
 * `updateWorldTime` that fires when world time reaches `fireAt`.
 *
 * ## Identity and overwrite semantics
 *
 * Each subscription is uniquely identified by `(uuid, actionName)`. Re-subscribing
 * with the same identity **overwrites** the previous entry. Documents
 * re-register their subscriptions on every preparation cycle, so only the most
 * recent registration matters.
 *
 * ## Populate everywhere, fire on the active GM only
 *
 * The queue is a **pure projection of document state**: every client — GM or
 * player — populates its own copy from its own document preparation, so
 * `subscribe` / `unsubscribe` / `scheduleAt` run on **all** clients. A player's
 * queue is therefore a *permission-scoped subset* of the active GM's (it holds
 * only the subscriptions for documents that client can see), which is exactly
 * enough to answer sheet-side date queries ({@link nextFireTime} /
 * {@link timeUntil}) locally.
 *
 * Only **`fire`** is gated to the active GM. Nothing else evolves schedule state,
 * so no GM-only side effect can drift the clients out of sync — schedule changes
 * flow through document updates (which replicate) and their re-preparation.
 *
 * ## Single-pass dispatch (no cascade)
 *
 * A `fire(ctx)` dispatches each matching subscription **once**, from a snapshot
 * taken at the start of the call. For `updateWorldTime`, "matching" additionally
 * requires the subscription be *due* (`fireAt` undefined or `<= worldTime`), and
 * due subscriptions dispatch in ascending `fireAt` order. Subscriptions a handler
 * adds mid-dispatch are **not** re-fired within the same call — they wait for the
 * next `fire`.
 *
 * The queue deliberately does **not** catch up recurring events over a large time
 * jump. That is the consuming document's responsibility: its handler resolves
 * every elapsed interval in `(lastAnchor, worldTime]` in one pass and persists the
 * advanced anchor, and its `finalize()` re-registers the single next occurrence
 * beyond `worldTime`. See the Event Queue reference doc for the contract.
 *
 * ## Loop protection
 *
 * Re-entrant `fire(...)` for the same trigger name is capped at
 * `MAX_TRIGGER_DEPTH` (16); beyond that the call aborts with an error. This
 * backstops non-time loops (e.g. a `combatStart` handler that fires
 * `combatStart`). Because there is no cascade, no same-tick guard is needed:
 * a handler that re-arms during dispatch simply schedules a subscription that the
 * next `fire` sees.
 *
 * ## Predicate error policy
 *
 * Predicates that throw are caught and logged; that dispatch is skipped; the
 * subscription is not removed. Predicates may legitimately fail on stale data
 * (e.g., resolving an effect that was just deleted) and one bad tick should not
 * permanently disarm a check.
