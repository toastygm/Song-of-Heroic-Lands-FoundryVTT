/**
 * **Scene environment triggers** — the environmental sibling of the
 * spatial {@link sohl.entity.event.SohlRegionTriggerName | region triggers}.
 * Where a region trigger fires on *where* a token is, an environment trigger
 * fires on *what the scene is doing* — currently the scene's darkness level.
 *
 * Like the region triggers these are **event-driven** (no `fireAt`): darkness
 * falls when the GM or an Adjust-Darkness behavior changes it, so
 * {@link sohl.entity.event.SohlEventQueue.nextFireTime | nextFireTime} is
 * `undefined` by design and the queryable temporal fact is `system.lastRun`.
 *
 * The trigger is fired from `SohlHookBridge` off Foundry's `updateScene` hook
 * (a scene-level change, not a per-region event); this module is the pure,
 * Foundry-free half — the derivation from an update payload to a trigger
 * context.
 *
 * @module SceneTriggers

 *
 * `darknessLevel` is an `AlphaField` (0–1), so a change to `0` is a real event,
