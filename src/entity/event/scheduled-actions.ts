/**
 * **Generic scheduled actions** — the data-driven half of the
 * {@link sohl.entity.event.SohlEventQueue | deferred action runner}.
 *
 * A recurring schedule is stored as data on **any** SoHL document, in the
 * `system.scheduledActions` field on the base data model (beside `actionDefs`).
 * Each entry defers an action — run `actionName` on that document's logic — to a
 * **moment**: either a **time** (`anchor + interval`, the default) or, when the
 * entry names a `triggerName`, a **lifecycle trigger** (`turnEnd`,
 * `combatStart`, a scene-region trigger, …) armed as a live subscription with no
 * fire time. Both families persist here and re-arm the same way. Two halves keep
 * it working:
 *
 * - **persist** — {@link scheduleAction} / {@link unscheduleAction} write the
 *   whole `system.scheduledActions` array, the durable record that survives a
 *   reload;
 * - **arm** — the same calls, plus {@link armScheduledActions} on load, push the
 *   entries into the event queue so they fire (offer a `[Perform]` reminder) when
 *   due.
 *
 * Both derive the fire time from the same `(anchor, interval)`, so they cannot
 * drift. Foundry-free: it operates on a minimal {@link Schedulable} surface and
 * the queue, so it is unit-testable without a running Foundry.
