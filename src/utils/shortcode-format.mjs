/**
 * The shape rule for `shortcode` — the system's identity key must be strictly
 * ASCII-alphanumeric. This is the single source of truth for that
 * rule, shared by the runtime create/update guard (`resolveShortcodeKey` in
 * `src/utils/helpers.ts`), the world migration that repairs legacy keys, and
 * the build-time `lint:packs` guard.
 *
 * Like `@heroiclands/package-build/sohl/default-item-art`, this module is
 * deliberately **plain ESM** — no
 * TypeScript, no `@src` aliases, no Foundry — because the pack/lint scripts run
 * under bare `node` (no bundler to resolve aliases or strip types) while the
 * bundled runtime imports the very same file. One copy of the pattern is what
 * keeps the build-time and runtime rules from drifting apart.
 *
 * **Why alphanumeric-only.** `shortcode` is a logical identity referenced from
 * saved world data, and it is also half of the `type-shortcode` address that
 * content wikilinks and knowledgebase pages parse — a parse that depends on the
 * separating hyphen being the only hyphen in the string. Any other punctuation
 * likewise has to survive URLs, YAML frontmatter, and expression source
 * unescaped.
 *
 * **Why lowercase.** This was once left open — "case is not
 * constrained … tightening that would be a separate decision" — and #1882 is
 * that decision, taken alongside `@heroiclands/package-build` 20.0.0, which
 * narrows the build-time rule the same way (package-build#340). The reason is
 * that case was never actually carrying a distinction: the **address** built
 * from a shortcode is lowercased, so `Clb` and `clb` published one address, one
 * document `_id` and one URL while the shortcode check saw two distinct keys.
 * That is an identity collapse nothing reported — a difference you can only see
 * by looking twice and cannot say out loud. Requiring lowercase makes the key
 * equal the thing derived from it.
 *
 * @module shortcode-format

/**
 * The shape every `shortcode` must match: lowercase ASCII letters and digits.
 *
 * This must stay identical to `@heroiclands/package-build`'s build-time copy —
 * `tests/build/shortcode-format-agreement.test.ts` is the only thing comparing
 * them, and a drift means the build accepts a key the runtime refuses to save,

/**
 * Reduce a shortcode to the characters the rule allows — `B&CFl` → `bcfl`,
 * `self-pro` → `selfpro`, `Tabûri` → `taburi`.
 *
 * This is the repair used where rejecting is not an option (the world migration,
 * and a create that opted into `shortcodeDedupe`). It differs from
 * `slugifyShortcode` (`src/utils/helpers.ts`), which **abbreviates and shortens**
 * as well because it derives a *new* key from a display name; here an existing
 * key is being kept as recognizable as possible, so every letter survives.
 *
 * **It lowercases, and must.** A repair has to land on a value the rule
 * accepts, or the world migration writes back something the create/update guard
 * still refuses — repairing nothing, every load, forever. Folding case is safe
 * in the way dropping characters is not, because the address and the document
 * `_id` derived from a shortcode were *already* lowercased: `Clb` and `clb`
 * denote the same entity, so `Clb` → `clb` is a canonical spelling of one key
 * rather than a change of key. Contrast `Tabûri` → `Tabri` below, which would
 * denote a different entity.
 *
 * **A letter is spelled, not deleted.** The value is carried into ASCII by
 * {@link toAsciiLetters} before anything is dropped, so an accented letter folds
 * (`û` → `u`) and a letter with no mark to separate is written out
 * (`Æ` → `AE`). Deleting instead would change *which entity the key names*:
 * `(type, shortcode)` is a logical identity, so repairing `Tabûri` to `Tabri`
 * stops the document matching the compendium entry it came from, silently and
 * irreversibly. Folding is a no-op on an ASCII key, so the
 * punctuation repairs above are unchanged.
 *
 * What the fold cannot carry into a letter or digit is still dropped: a vulgar
 * fraction has no canonical decomposition, so `Kûrbúl ¾-Helm` repairs to
 * `KurbulHelm`.
 *
 * @param {unknown} value - the shortcode to repair.
 * @returns {string} the alphanumeric residue (`""` when nothing survives).
