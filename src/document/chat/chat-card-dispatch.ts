 * and the opposed-test cards use `data-action-handler-uuid`. Rather than
 * rename attributes across every template (which would risk regressions and
 * break any in-flight chat messages), the dispatcher normalizes the *reader*
 * here.
 *
 * Pure function — no DOM or Foundry globals — so it is unit-testable. The
 * `renderChatMessageHTML` hook in `sohl.ts` calls this with the clicked
 * element's `dataset`.
 *
 * Precedence (most specific / legacy first):
 *   1. `data-doc-uuid`            (standard-test, fate, edit-action cards)

 *   3. `data-handler-actor-uuid`  (attack-card defender responder)
 *   4. `data-action-handler-uuid` (opposed-request / opposed-result cards)

/**
 * Resolve the handler document for a chat-card click **and authorize it** — the

 * all). Returns the document when authorized, or `null` when the click must be
 * ignored (no handler uuid, the uuid does not resolve, or the client is not an
 * owner).
 *
 * Chat cards address their buttons to the actor that should *handle* the click
 * (via {@link resolveChatCardHandlerUuid}'s attributes — most explicitly
 * `data-handler-actor-uuid`). An action run from a card mutates that actor's own
 * state, so — under actor-state sovereignty — only a client that owns the actor
 * may run it. This is the **click-time** half of that rule; the render-time half
 * (`gateAutomatedDefenseButtons`) hides buttons the client can't use. The
 * render-time gate is UX only and is bypassable by a synthesized click or a
 * direct handler call, so this authorization gate is the real boundary before
 * any dialog, scope revival, or intrinsic logic runs.
 *
 * Pure: Foundry document resolution is injected via `resolveDoc` (the caller
 * passes `foundry.utils.fromUuidSync`), so this stays Foundry-free and
 * unit-testable, mirroring `gateAutomatedDefenseButtons`.
 *
 * The {@link SELF_HANDLER} sentinel (`@self`) is resolved via `resolveSelf`
 * instead — the clicking user's own default character — supporting **open**
 * sequence buttons that anyone may answer.
 *
 * @param dataset - The clicked element's `dataset`.
 * @param resolveDoc - Resolves a document from its uuid (the caller supplies the
 *   Foundry lookup).
 * @param resolveSelf - Resolves the clicking user's default character (for the
 *   `@self` handler). Optional; when absent, `@self` buttons are ignored.
 * @returns The authorized handler document, or `null` if the click is not
 *   authorized and must be ignored.

 * logic. Warns via `sohl.log.warn` when no handler is found.
 *
 * Pure dispatch path — callers are responsible for the ownership check before
 * calling this function.
 *
 * An **action card** (see {@link sohl.document.chat.buildActionCard}) marks its
 * buttons with `data-skip-dialog="true"`: because the card already carries the
 * action's parameters in `data-scope`, the click runs the action with
 * {@link sohl.entity.action.SohlActionContext.skipDialog} set, so the action
 * proceeds without prompting. A human invoking the same action from a sheet
 * (no `data-skip-dialog`) gets its dialog instead — the card and the sheet call
 * the *same* self-sufficient action.
 *
 * @param logic - The logic instance that should handle the action.
 * @param btn - The clicked element (button or anchor); `dataset.action` names
