 * carry the `action-card-button` class; this gate touches only those, so a
 * card's other markup is left alone.

 * action-card buttons. Foundry document resolution is injected via `resolveDoc`,

 * Render-time gating for an attack card's defender-response buttons.

 * defense buttons — Dodge / Counterstrike / Block / Ignore. Which ones a given
 * client may actually use is decided here, when the card renders on that client,
 * because the decision is viewer-dependent (ownership) and needs the *defender's*
 * own view of its strike modes (an attacker may not be able to enumerate them):
 *
 * - **Owner gate:** only a user who owns the defender actor (a GM owns all) may
 *   respond — everyone else sees no defense buttons.
 * - **Incapacitation gate (owner only):** if the defender is dead/unconscious/
 *   asleep/restrained/paralyzed/frozen/incapacitated, **Ignore is the only viable
 *   defense** — Dodge / Block / Counterstrike are all removed.
 * - **Capability gate (owner only):** **Block** shows only if the defender has a
 *   non-`noBlock` melee mode; **Counterstrike** only if it has a non-`noAttack`
 *   melee mode. **Dodge** and **Ignore** are always available to the owner.
 *
 * Composes the pure, unit-tested capability helpers and manipulates the DOM.
 * Foundry document resolution is injected via `resolveDefender` (the caller
 * passes `foundry.utils.fromUuidSync`), so the gating itself carries no Foundry
 * dependency and is unit-testable with a stub element + stub defender. A no-op
 * on any card without these buttons.
 *
 * @param element - The chat message's rendered root element.
 * @param resolveDefender - Resolves the defender document from a button's
 *   `data-handler-actor-uuid` (the caller supplies the Foundry lookup).
