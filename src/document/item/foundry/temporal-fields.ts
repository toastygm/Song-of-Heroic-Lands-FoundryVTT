 * `{name}Date` from a template literal.
 *
 * A schema whose keys are assembled from an argument has field names that exist
 * only after the argument is applied — so they are not in the source, and
 * `package-build schema`, which reads this file as data rather than running it,
 * cannot name them. Every such field would be missing from the published
 * schema, and content authoring `system.onsetDate` would be told no DataModel
 * declares it.
 *
 * Callers spell the names out and call the field helpers above directly. The
 * saving would be three lines per phase; the cost would be a schema that cannot
 * describe a third of what `affliction` and `trauma` actually store.
 *
 * The recurrence *anchor* is not among them: it lives in the generic
 * `system.scheduledActions` store, whose entry's
 * `anchor + interval` is the next fire time.
