 * Mystical Abilities represent spells, rites, invocations, and other powers

 * Each ability is linked to an **associated skill** (via shortcode) that
 * governs its activation test. Abilities track a **level** (power),
 * **charges** (uses remaining), and track mastery level progression via
 * {@link sohl.entity.modifier.MasteryLevelModifier}.
 *
 * Supported subtypes:
 * - Spirit Rite: Perform a spirit rite on target(s)
 * - Spirit Action: Spirit world interaction (Roaming, Sensing, Communing, etc.)
 * - Spirit Power: Channel spirit power (Ancestor, Totem, or Energy)
 * - Ritual Action: Perform a prescribed ritual to earn a deity's favour
 * - Divine Incantation: Cast divine spells
 * - Arcane Incantation: Cast arcane spells
 * - Arcane Talent: Intrinsic spell-like arcane powers
 * - Spirit Talent: Intrinsic spell-like spirit powers
 * - Alchemy: Create alchemical elixirs or perform alchemical actions
