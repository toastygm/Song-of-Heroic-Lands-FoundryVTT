 * Abstract base logic for all physical gear items — the foundation for
 * {@link ArmorGearLogic}, {@link WeaponGearLogic}, {@link MiscGearLogic},
 * {@link ContainerGearLogic}, {@link ConcoctionGearLogic}, and
 * {@link ProjectileGearLogic}.
 *
 * Gear items represent tangible objects that a character can carry, equip,
 * buy, sell, or trade. All gear shares these tracked properties:
 *
 * - **weight** — Physical weight, modified by enchantments or materials
 * - **value** — Monetary worth in the campaign's currency
 * - **quality** — Craftsmanship level, affecting durability and effectiveness
 * - **durability** — Current structural integrity; damaged gear may break
 *
 * Gear also tracks inventory state: whether it is **carried** (on the character's
 * person). The **worn** state is armor-specific and lives on
 * {@link ArmorGearLogic} as `isWorn`.
 *
 * @typeParam TData - The gear data interface.
