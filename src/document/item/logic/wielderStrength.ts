/**
 * Folding the wielder's Strength into their strike modes' impact.
 *
 * The rule itself is Foundry-free and lives in
 * {@link sohl.entity.strikemode.applyStrengthImpact}; this module is the thin
 * document-layer wiring that gathers what the rule needs — the wielder's
 * Strength, their dominant side, and which limbs grip the weapon — and is
 * called by both carriers of strike modes: a weapon
 * ({@link sohl.document.item.logic.WeaponGearLogic}) and a combat-technique
 * skill ({@link sohl.document.item.logic.SkillLogic}).
 *
 * It runs in the **finalize** phase, not evaluate: it reads the wielder's
 * Strength attribute across documents, and attribute scores are only settled
 * once every sibling item has evaluated — the same cross-item read the
 * governing mastery-level wiring makes.
