/**
 * A passive or charge-based mystical power associated with a character or
 * object.
 *
 * Mysteries represent supernatural gifts, blessings, and connections that
 * influence a character's capabilities. Unlike {@link MysticalAbilityLogic | Mystical Abilities}
 * (which are actively cast), mysteries are often passive or limited-use
 * powers that enhance skills, grant re-rolls, or provide divine favor.
 *
 * A Mystery models what a character **is** — a standing condition, pool, or
 * blessing — so it carries no "use it" action of its own: there is no universal
 * meaning to *using* a Mystery. Anything a character actively **invokes** is a
 * {@link MysticalAbilityLogic | Mystical Ability}, which has its own action and
 * roll; a subtype that should be spent down is driven by whatever consumes it.
 *
 * Each mystery tracks a **level** and optional **charges** (value and max); a
 * `null` charge value denotes infinite uses. A mystery may name an associated
 * {@link SkillLogic | Skill} (e.g. the skill a boon or boost affects).
 *
 * Subtypes ({@link MysterySubType}):
 * - **Boon** — a flat `±N` modifier to an associated skill's mastery level, from any source.
 * - **Boost** — one or more temporary Mastery Boosts to an associated skill (the Mastery Boost table).
 * - **Fate** — quantifies the ability to alter destiny or fate (the stored fate pool). The "Fate" *invocation* is a Divination {@link MysticalAbilityLogic | Mystical Ability}; a per-skill fate bonus is modelled with Active Effects, and a fate-point bonus is not yet modelled.
 * - **Grace** — quantifies the ability to call effectually on divine favour.
 * - **Other** — a mechanically inert carrier with no behaviour of its own; a birthsign (a passive standing influence on whole classes of skills) is authored this way, carrying its effect entirely in {@link MysteryData.skillAptitudes}.
 * - **Piety** — quantifies devotion to a religion.
 *
 * A **Boon** or **Boost** mystery names its target skill via
 * {@link MysteryData.assocSkillCode} and, while active (a present, non-zero
 * {@link level}), contributes a live delta onto that skill's mastery level in
 * {@link finalize}. The mystery's {@link level | level} carries the effect's
 * magnitude — `±N` for a Boon, the boost count `N` for a Boost.
 *
 * @typeParam TData - The Mystery data interface.
