/**
 * Foundry-free helpers backing the **Fate** mechanic.
 *
 * A player may spend a Fate Point *after* a test is rolled to raise that test's
 * success level — the die is never re-rolled. These pure functions encode the
 * two decisions that drive the flow:
 *
 * 1. **Which Fate Points may be spent** on a given skill's test
 *    ({@link eligibleFateSources}, {@link fatePointsAvailable},
 *    {@link preferredFateSource}); and
 * 2. **What a rolled Fate test does** to the original test — how many success
 *    levels it adds and whether it consumes a point ({@link resolveFateOutcome}).
 *
 * Both are data-driven and side-effect-free so they unit-test without Foundry
 * and never re-implement the "is it a success?" heuristic the bug in #854 came
 * from — consumption and the level bump are keyed on the **matched rung**, not
 * `isSuccess`.
