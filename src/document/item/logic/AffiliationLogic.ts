/**
 * Membership in an organization or faction.

 *
 * - **subType** — The kind of body it is, from the content format's eleven
 *   (see {@link AffiliationSubType})
 * - **society** — The name of the organization
 * - **office** — A specific position held (e.g., "Captain," "Acolyte")
 * - **title** — A formal title granted (e.g., "Sir," "Elder")
 * - **level** — Rank or standing within the organization
 * - **relations** — How the organization stands toward *other* affiliations
 *
 * Affiliations are lightweight identity records with no complex calculations.
 * They can be attached to Beings, Cohorts, Structures, or Vehicles.
