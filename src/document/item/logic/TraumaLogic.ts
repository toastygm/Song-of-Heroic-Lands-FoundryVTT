 * An instance of harm to a character.

 * {@link TraumaData.bodyLocationCode | body location}), or a mind/spirit/body
 * condition — `fear`, `morale`, `pall`, `psycond` (psychological condition),
 * `auralshock`, `fatigue`, `infection`, `shock`, or `coma`.
 *
 * Each trauma tracks:
 *
 * - **subType** — Category of harm (injury | fear | morale | pall | psycond |
 *   auralshock | fatigue | infection | shock | coma)
 * - **injuryLevel** — Severity on a graduated scale: M1 (Minor), S2–S3
 *   (Serious), G4–G5 (Grievous), with higher levels causing greater
 *   impairment and risk of death
 * - **healingRate** — How quickly the wound heals (influenced by treatment)
 * - **aspect** — The type of damage that caused the trauma (Blunt, Pierce,
 *   Cut, Heat, Cold), which affects treatment and healing
 * - **isTreated** — Whether the trauma has received medical treatment
 *   (untreated wounds heal slower and risk infection)
 *
 * Trauma contributes to the character's overall shock state
 * and (for physical subtype) interacts with the anatomy model (body
 * roles, body parts, body locations) to determine hit location effects.
 *
 * Trauma supports treatment and healing test actions.
