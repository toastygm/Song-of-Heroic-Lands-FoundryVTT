 * Dissolved from the former Corpus item into the Being: rather than a
 * separate embedded document, a Being owns its body directly. `BodyLogic` is a
 * plain, Being-owned domain object (not a `SohlLogic`) that wraps the persisted
 * {@link BodyLogic.Data | body data} into live derived state — the
 * {@link sohl.entity.body.BodyStructure | anatomy}, and `weight` / `reach` /
 * `bodyScale` as {@link sohl.entity.modifier.ValueModifier}s so runtime effects
 * (size changes, encumbrance) can layer on.
 *
 * The body's entities ({@link sohl.entity.body.BodyStructure} and its parts /
 * locations) are parented to the owning {@link sohl.document.actor.logic.BeingLogic}
 * (a real Logic), so ValueModifiers, actor lookups, and persistence resolve
 * against the being document; this object is only the derivation + accessor
 * seam exposed as `being.body`.
 *
 * **Incorporeality** is an empty body — `structure.parts.length === 0` — not an
 * absent object (see {@link isIncorporeal}).
