/**
 * The pure aggregation behind a Cohort's **Shared Gear** tab.
 *

 * have marked as shared with it — the item stays on the carrying actor (its
 * custodian), and the cohort view never duplicates, moves, or edits it. These
 * helpers do the matching and row assembly with no Foundry and no document
 * lookups; {@link sohl.document.actor.logic.CohortLogic} supplies the resolved
 * members and this cohort's own reference keys.
