/**
 * Being health derivation — impairment-based, banded.
 *
 * SoHL has **no hit points**: health is a banded assessment of capability, not a
 * pool. It is driven by **impaired body parts only** — an injury that impairs no
 * part has zero effect. Each impaired part sets a ceiling on overall health by
 * its state (impairment tier, or unusable) and whether it is **critical** (holds
 * a VITAL or CORE role); the physical health is the **minimum** ceiling across
 * all impaired parts (100 when nothing is impaired).
 *
 * `max` is always 100; `value` is that ceiling, floored at 1 for any living
 * being and 0 only when `dead`. The value maps to bands (Excellent … Dead).
 *
 * Stun/fatigue/fear/shock ceilings are deliberately out of scope here — they are
 * separate ceilings that will later compose by `min` with this physical one.
 *
 * Pure and Foundry-free; consumed by {@link BeingLogic}.
