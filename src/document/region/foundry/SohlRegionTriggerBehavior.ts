/**
 * **The scene-region → event-queue bridge**: a Foundry v14
 * `RegionBehaviorType` a GM drops onto a scene region to opt it into SoHL
 * triggering. Registered as the `trigger` RegionBehavior subtype; Foundry
 * auto-generates its config sheet from this schema.
 *
 * This is the GM opt-in surface for the "automation only at a human's behest"
 * posture — nothing happens until a GM places the behavior on a region and
 * picks which events it forwards. When a curated event fires, the behavior:
 *
 * 1. forwards the event into SoHL's queue via
 *    {@link sohl.entity.event.fireSohlTrigger}, so any actor/item subscription
 *    on that trigger reacts (predicate-scoped to a region or character); and
 * 2. if the GM authored an `actionName`, **offers** that action to the entering
 *    token's actor — an owner-gated `[Perform]` reminder (the crypt-Fear-test
 *    archetype). The queue reminds; the human performs.
 *
 * **Dispatch once.** Foundry delivers a region event to the behavior on *every*
 * connected client (the triggering client plus a socket broadcast), so the
 * whole forward is gated to the active GM — the trigger dispatches exactly once,
 * not once per client. The entering token is resolved to its actor here, at the
 * Foundry boundary; the logic layer sees only the resolved UUIDs.
