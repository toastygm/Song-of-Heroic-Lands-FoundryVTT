/**
 * CI guard: the rules corpus never describes the VTT that implements it.
 *
 * The rules exist above the game — they are the specification the Foundry
 * system implements, and must read as though no VTT exists. A rule that says
 * "click **Accept** on the card in the chat log" describes an interface, not a
 * game; when the interface changes, the rule silently becomes wrong.
 *
 * Automation behaviour — the consent/offer flow, what is prompted and when —
 * is genuinely useful, but its home is the **User Guide**
 * (`assets/content/User_Guide/`), which this guard deliberately does not scan.
 * Move such prose there rather than deleting it.
 *
 * Scans every `.md` file under `assets/content/Rules/`, skipping YAML
 * frontmatter and fenced `sql` blocks (both are structural, not prose).
 * Prints offending `file:line` locations and exits non-zero on any match.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run lint:rules-vtt         // node utils/check-rules-vtt.mjs
 *   node utils/check-rules-vtt.mjs // direct invocation (no args)
