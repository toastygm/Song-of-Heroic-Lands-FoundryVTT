/**
 * Assemble the deployable `/sohl/` site.
 *
 * This repository publishes one standalone site covering everything under
 * `/sohl/`, and two different builds produce it:
 *
 * - **Hugo** renders the package landing and the knowledgebase into
 *   `build/site/sohl/` (`npm run build:kb` — the prefix comes from `publishDir`
 *   in `kb/hugo.toml`, not from this script).
 * - **TypeDoc** generates the API documentation into `build/docs-html`
 *   (`npm run docs:html`), which is plain HTML with relative links, so it is
 *   mounted here as a static tree at `build/site/sohl/api/`.
 *
 * The deployment carries the `/sohl/` prefix physically. That is what lets the
 * hosting project be checked at its own address before any routing points at
 * it — every link the pages emit is `/sohl/…`, and it resolves against the
 * deployment exactly as it will against www — and it leaves the routing layer
 * a pure path-preserving pass-through with nothing to rewrite.
 *
 * Usage: node utils/build-site.mjs [--api <dir>]

 * A Cloudflare Pages project answers at **three** families of address besides
 * its canonical path on `www.heroiclands.org`: `<project>.pages.dev`, one
 * `<deployment>.<project>.pages.dev` per deployment, and
 * `<package>.{@link ORIGIN_SUFFIX}` — the custom domain the project carries so
 * the routing layer has an origin to fetch. None is advertised, all serve the
 * same pages, and left alone they are indexed and compete with the canonical
 * URL in search results.
 *
 * The third rule is the newest, and until #1765 this file did not carry it:
 * measured at the edge on 2026-08-30, `https://sohl-kb.pages.dev/sohl/` answered
 * with `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` while `https://sohl.pkg.heroiclands.org/sohl/` —
 * the *same deployment*, byte-identical body — answered 200 with none. So the
 * two-rule payload left the address a reader is most plausibly handed fully
 * indexable.
 *
 * The rules are **scoped to those hostnames**, which is what keeps this file
 * correct for anyone who takes the repository elsewhere: deployed under its own
 * domain the site is indexable, and only the host-assigned addresses are not.
 * `:project`, `:version` and `:package` are Cloudflare's own placeholders — a
 * named wildcard matching exactly **one label**, since the delimiter inside a
 * host is the dot.
 *
 * That single-label rule is also what keeps the canonical address out of the
 * third rule: `:package.pkg.heroiclands.org` requires four labels and a literal
 * `pkg`, so the three-label `www.heroiclands.org` cannot match it. This holds
 * only while {@link ORIGIN_SUFFIX} names a dedicated namespace rather than the
 * domain the canonical site is served from — a consumer whose site is
 * `www.example.net` must not set it to `example.net`, which would match `www`
 * here and equally give the router `/www/` as a package prefix.
 *
 * The hosting cannot tell the routing layer's request apart from a reader's —
 * it is the same URL at the same address — so this header reaches
 * `www.heroiclands.org` too, and the router (`heroiclands-site`, `worker/`,
 * `canonicalHeaders`) removes it there. That is the only place the two
 * addresses are distinguishable, and it is why the third rule carries a risk the
 * first two did not: until heroiclands-site#26 the router's origin *was*
 * `<project>.pages.dev`, so the first rule already set `noindex` on every
 * response it fetched and `www` never carried it. #26 moved the origin to the
 * custom domain, which in one change opened this hole and left the strip with
 * nothing to strip; this restores an arrangement that ran in production.
 *
 * A page that needs `noindex` at *every* address must say so in the document
 * (`<meta name="robots">`), which is body content and is passed through
 * untouched.
