/**
 * CI guard: the frozen-subset Cypress e2e suite must stay green with no
 * **in-scope** spec left RED-skipped. This enforces Blocker III of the
 * Being-centric beta freeze.
 *
 * The whole `cypress/e2e` suite is **in scope** by default: every spec is
 * expected to pass on the frozen path. The only `it.skip` / `describe.skip`
 * cases permitted are the **fenced-RED allowlist** below — RED specs blocked by
 * a fenced (out-of-scope-for-beta) feature or explicitly post-freeze behavior,
 * each keyed to the GitHub issue that will un-skip it. A skip that cites an
 * issue *not* in the allowlist is an in-scope spec gone RED: either make it
 * green, or (if the maintainer has decided to fence its feature) add the issue
 * to the allowlist with a justification.
 *
 * **The convention this enforces:** every RED skip must cite its blocking
 * issue(s) as `(#NN)` in the test title (or, for a whole-suite fence via
 * `itemSheetSuite`, in the `red` / `persistRed` option value). That is what
 * makes the skip auditable and lets this static check map it to the allowlist
 * without running Foundry.
 *
 * Scans every `*.cy.js` under `cypress/e2e/`; writes nothing. Prints offending
 * `file:line` locations and exits non-zero (failing CI) on any violation.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run lint:e2e-red          // node utils/check-e2e-red.mjs
 *   node utils/check-e2e-red.mjs  // direct invocation (no args)
