/**
 * Generate the "Bound variables" section of
 * `kb/dev-docs/concepts/expressions.md` from the expression-scope catalog
 * (`src/entity/expr/expression-scopes.mjs`).
 *
 * The catalog is the same module the runtime validates against and the editor
 * autocompletes from, so a generated table cannot drift from the code the way
 * a hand-maintained one does — that drifts to documenting only some call
 * sites, and nothing fails.
 *
 * Run via `npm run docs:expr-scopes`; `npm run lint` runs this with `--check`
 * and fails when the committed section is stale.
 *
 * Only the region between the BEGIN/END markers is rewritten — the surrounding
 * prose stays hand-written.
 *
 * The result is then run through Prettier, so the page satisfies the generator
 * and `prettier --check` at once. Without that the two disagree permanently:
 * Prettier realigns the generated table's columns, this generator writes them
 * back, and whichever ran last leaves the other failing. Formatting here is what
 * lets the page stay under Prettier rather than being excluded from it — it is a
 * hand-written concept doc that happens to carry one generated table, so
 * excluding it would leave all of its prose unformatted.
