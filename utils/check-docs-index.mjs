/**
 * CI guard: keep the hand-maintained developer-doc index in sync with the files
 * on disk, so a new `kb/dev-docs/<section>/<page>.md` can never be silently
 * orphaned from the navigation.
 *
 * Every content page under any `kb/dev-docs/<section>/` directory must be linked
 * from `kb/dev-docs/README.md` — the doc-tree landing (rendered as the
 * `/dev-docs/` landing on the knowledgebase, and the GitHub-facing index).
 * Exits non-zero on any omission.
 *
 * **The sections are read off disk, not listed here.** A literal array would
 * leave a *new* section invisible to this guard rather than covered by it —
 * every page in it orphaned silently, which is the one failure this script
 * exists to prevent. Discovering them makes adding a section safe by default:
 * the guard picks it up the moment the directory exists.
 *
 * (The API site carries no guide tree, so there is no per-section `children:`
 * stub to cross-check; the README is the single index.)
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run lint:docs-index
 *   node utils/check-docs-index.mjs
