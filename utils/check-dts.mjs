/**
 * CI guard: type-check the project's own declaration files with `skipLibCheck`
 * OFF, and fail on any error in a file we own.
 *
 * `tsconfig.json` keeps `skipLibCheck: true` globally — deliberately — because
 * third-party declaration files we don't control (`fvtt-types`, `jsep`) contain
 * type errors that would otherwise break every build. But that flag also hides
 * errors in OUR own `.d.ts` files: `types/sohl-globals.d.ts` once rotted into a
 * set of imports from a non-existent source layout, which silently degraded the
 * `sohl` global and every SoHL document type to `any` without failing the build.
 *
 * This guard runs a one-off `tsc --skipLibCheck false` and reports only the
 * errors outside `node_modules/` — catching regressions in our declaration
 * files while ignoring the library noise that `skipLibCheck` exists to suppress.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run lint:dts        // node utils/check-dts.mjs
 *   node utils/check-dts.mjs
