/**
 * CI guard: validate the generated `packages/sohl-types/index.d.ts` as the
 * artifact a *consumer* installs, rather than as a file that happens to compile
 * here.
 *
 * `tsc -p packages/sohl-types/test/tsconfig.json` type-checks the bundle from
 * inside this repository, where every third-party module it imports resolves
 * from the root `node_modules` whether or not the package declares it. That is
 * the blind spot this closes: a broken types package looks fine from the
 * only place anyone looked. These checks are the ones that only make sense from
 * the outside.
 *
 * What it asserts:
 *
 *   1. Every bare module the bundle imports is declared in the package's
 *      `peerDependencies` — so an install actually resolves it.
 *   2. No synthesized private names (`__#N@#member`). TypeScript emits these
 *      when a declaration's inferred type references a `#private` member, and
 *      no downstream `.d.ts` consumer — including `rollup-plugin-dts` — can
 *      parse them. Fix by annotating the offending declaration's type.
 *   3. Every name the bundle re-exports is actually declared in it, and the
 *      `sohl` global is typed. An empty or hollowed-out bundle is worse than a
 *      failed build, because it degrades consumers to `any` in silence.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run check:sohl-types      // builds, type-checks, then runs this
 *   node utils/check-sohl-types.mjs
