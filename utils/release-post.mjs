/**
 * The two things that happen *after* a release is cut, and that only this
 * repository does.
 *
 * Every HeroicLands Foundry package now releases through one shared workflow,
 * which knows how to version, build, package and cut
 * the Release — and deliberately knows nothing about what any one package does
 * afterwards. This script is that seam: the shared workflow runs
 * `npm run release:post` once the Release exists, with `GH_TOKEN` and
 * `RELEASE_TAG` in the environment, and takes no interest in what it contains.
 *
 * It runs **after** the Release, so nothing here can be the reason a release
 * was not cut.
 *
 * The two steps have deliberately different failure behaviour, which is the
 * whole reason this is a script rather than two workflow steps. The workflow it
 * replaces marked the npm publish `continue-on-error: true` — but that
 * attribute is per-step and blunt: it swallows *everything* the step does. A
 * script can say which half is best-effort and which is not.
 *
 *   1. **Republish /sohl/ — required.** A published release moves the API half
 *      of the site, which documents the newest release tag rather than `main`.
 *      A failure here means the site still describes the previous release, so
 *      it fails the job.
 *
 *   2. **Publish @heroiclands/sohl-types — best effort.** Foundry installs from
 *      the Release's `system.zip`, never from npm, so a registry failure must
 *      not mark a successful release as failed. It is reported as a workflow
 *      error annotation (loud, visible in the run summary) without failing.
 *
 * The publish is idempotent: a version already on the registry is skipped, so
 * re-running the workflow for an existing release republishes nothing.

/**
 * Publish the types-only npm package via npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) — no

 *
 * Requires a Trusted Publisher configured on npm for `@heroiclands/sohl-types`
 * pointing at this repository and `.github/workflows/release.yml`, plus
 * `id-token: write`. **The workflow filename is the load-bearing part**: npm
 * authorizes the workflow that *initiates* the run, not the reusable one it
 * calls, so moving the body of the release into a shared workflow needs no
 * change on npm — as long as the caller here keeps its name.
 *
 * The package is versioned by hand in `packages/sohl-types/package.json`,
 * independently of the system version; its `prepack` regenerates `index.d.ts`
 * from source at pack time. npm >= 11.5 is required for OIDC, so the runner's
 * npm is upgraded first.
