/**
 * CI guard: every relative link in the developer docs lands on something real.
 *
 * `kb/dev-docs/**` links by **relative path**, deliberately — the tree is read
 * in the repository and on GitHub as much as on the knowledgebase, and a path is
 * what those renderers follow. Wikilinks cannot address these pages at all: the
 * KB index is keyed by `(type, shortcode)` and developer docs carry no
 * frontmatter (see `utils/build-kb-content.mjs`).
 *
 * The cost of a path is that it encodes location, so moving a page breaks every
 * link into it and nothing says so. That is not hypothetical: when this guard
 * was first run it found **25** dead links. The `docs/` → `kb/dev-docs/`
 * move had left 22 repo-root links one directory too high — invisible in both
 * places it mattered, since the knowledgebase rewrote them to a GitHub 404 under
 * `blob/main/kb/src/…` and in the repository they simply pointed at nothing.
 *
 * `check-content-links.mjs` does this job for `assets/content`; this is its
 * counterpart for the developer tree. Two things are checked:
 *
 * 1. **The target exists.** Any relative link — to a doc, a source file, a
 *    config — is resolved against the linking file's directory.
 * 2. **The `#anchor` exists**, when the target is markdown. Anchors are matched
 *    against the headings the target declares, using GitHub's slug rules, which
 *    is what both GitHub and Hugo generate for a heading.
 *
 * External links (`http:`, `https:`, `mailto:`), site-root links (`/sohl/api/`
 * — a published address, not a path in this tree), in-page links on a
 * non-markdown target, and anything inside a code fence or code span are left
 * alone.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run lint:doc-links
 *   node utils/check-doc-links.mjs
