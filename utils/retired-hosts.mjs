/**
 * The hostnames this project has withdrawn, and what replaced each one.
 *
 * A link to a retired host is worse than a dated one: the DNS record is gone,
 * so it fails at resolution with no redirect to follow. Nothing in the build
 * notices — an absolute URL is opaque to the wikilink checks, compiles cleanly
 * into the Foundry journals, and publishes to the knowledgebase looking exactly
 * like a working link. That is how 71 of them shipped.
 *
 * This module is the single list, so a guard and its test share one definition
 * of "retired" rather than two copies that can disagree.
