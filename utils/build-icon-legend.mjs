/*
 * Generates the user guide's "Icon Legend" page from the code that actually
 * defines the icons, so the page cannot drift from the interface it documents.
 *
 * Sources of truth (all read straight from `src/`):
 *   - ITEM_METADATA / ACTOR_METADATA in src/utils/constants.ts  -> document-type icons
 *   - the Being sheet's static TABS                             -> tab-strip icons
 *   - every `iconFAClass` in a `defineIntrinsicActions()` body  -> action icons
 *
 * Human-readable names come from lang/en.json, so the legend reads the way the
 * interface does rather than exposing shortcodes.
 *
 * Output: assets/content/User_Guide/Icon_Legend.md — single-sourced to the
 * in-Foundry journal (markdown-it, `html: true`) and to the knowledgebase
 * (goldmark, `unsafe = true`). Both pass raw HTML through, so each row renders
 * the real glyph via `<i class="…">` rather than naming a CSS class.
 *
 * Run: npm run build:icon-legend

# Icon Legend

Song of Heroic Lands uses a small, consistent set of icons. The same glyph always means the same thing, whether it appears on a sheet tab, beside a row, or in a right-click menu. This page shows every one of them.

Icons come from two families: [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) (its free set) and [Game-Icons.net](https://game-icons.net) for the arms, gear, and condition glyphs that Font Awesome does not cover.
