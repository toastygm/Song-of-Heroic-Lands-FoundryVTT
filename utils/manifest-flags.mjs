/**

 * state, called by `package-build manifest` (package-build#9).
 *
 * Everything else in the manifest is a literal, and literals belong in
 * `package-build.config.yaml` — which is where the other 190-odd lines of the
 * retired `system.template.json` now live. What is left here is the one value
 * that cannot be written down: an address that does not exist until the content
 * tree has been walked.
 *
 * The rest of the `sohl` flag namespace is read from `package.json`, the file
 * that owns each of those URLs. They were transcribed into the template once,
 * and that is exactly the drift this whole change removes.
