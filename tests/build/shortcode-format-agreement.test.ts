/**
 * The shortcode shape rule is stated twice, and the two copies must agree.
 *
 * It has to be stated twice. `@heroiclands/package-build` owns the build-time
 * rule — it lints every package's content tree, including the two this
 * repository does not contain — while the **runtime** enforces the same rule on
 * a live document (`resolveShortcodeKey`, and the migration that repairs legacy
 * keys). Shipped code cannot import a `devDependency`, so the runtime keeps its
 * own plain-ESM copy in `src/utils/shortcode-format.mjs`.
 *
 * Two copies of one rule is exactly the arrangement that drifts silently, and a
 * drift here is not cosmetic: the build would accept a key the runtime refuses
 * to save, or the runtime would accept one that breaks the `type-shortcode`
 * address whose parse needs the separating hyphen to be the only hyphen
 *. Nothing else compares them, so this test is the seam — the same job
 * `manifest-package-id.test.ts` does for the package id, and
 * `src-import-severance.test.ts` for the installed package's imports.
 *
 * It asserts against the **installed** package under `node_modules/`, not a
 * working copy, because that is the only form a consumer ever sees.
