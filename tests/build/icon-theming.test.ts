 * so the obligation falls on the source files: an icon that states its colour
 * as a `fill` **attribute** themes, and one that states it in a style attribute
 * ships black — invisible on the dark compendium and directory windows, whose
 * `<img>` thumbnails SoHL's `.sohl`-scoped CSS cannot reach.
 *
 * Forty-five bundled icons were authored the second way, five of them default
 * item or actor art. This suite is the standing gate that keeps the set
 * at zero: a newly added icon carrying inline fills fails here rather than
 * shipping un-themed.
