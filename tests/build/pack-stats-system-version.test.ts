 * version that ships in it.
 *
 * It was a hand-maintained literal, frozen at `0.6.0` while the system shipped
 * releases up to `0.8.2`. A document that under-reports its version is
 * eligible for migrations it does not need — the same defect `_stats.coreVersion`
 * had before it started following the manifest's `compatibility.minimum`
