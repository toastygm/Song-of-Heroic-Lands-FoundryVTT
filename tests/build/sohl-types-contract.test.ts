 *: the build is not part of `build:noci`, and the release workflow's
 * publish step is `continue-on-error`, so neither direction surfaced it.
 *
 * These are static-configuration assertions — cheap, and they run in the normal
 * `npm run test` pass. The artifact itself is validated by
 * `utils/check-sohl-types.mjs` (`npm run check:sohl-types`), which needs the
