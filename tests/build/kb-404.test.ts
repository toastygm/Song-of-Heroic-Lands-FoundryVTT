/**
 * The site must publish a `404.html`.
 *
 * Cloudflare Pages serves the nearest `404.html` — with a genuine 404 status —
 * for any path the site does not publish, and falls back to the site **root**
 * when that file is missing. The fallback is a soft-404: a 200 and the landing
 * page, which reads as success to every "does this URL resolve?" check and lets
 * search engines index retired content as live.
 *
 * The **template** lives in the shared theme, because every consumer needs one
 * and none should keep its own copy. That splits the contract in
 * two, and only one half is ours:
 *
 * - _The theme_ owns `layouts/404.html`. It arrives as the npm package
 *   `@heroiclands/hugo-theme`, which the job running this suite does
 *   not install, so these assertions do not read it — asserting on an absent
 *   directory would fail for the wrong reason.
 * - _This repository_ owns the wording and the routes back, via
 *   `params.notfound` in `kb/hugo.toml`, and owns the deploy that publishes the
 *   artifact.
 *
 * So the assertions below pin what this repository can actually regress: the
 * consumer configuration, the assembly step that refuses to ship a build
 * missing the file, and a deploy that puts the theme in front of Hugo at all.
 *
 * That last one is deliberately pinned to the *outcome* rather than to a
 * mechanism. Pinning how the theme arrives makes the assertion fail whenever
 * that changes, while the behaviour it guards is fine. What must hold is that
 * the theme is installed before Hugo runs, whatever installs it.
