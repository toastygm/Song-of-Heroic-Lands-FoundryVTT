 * two files **at the repository root**, and nothing else. A `.gitignore` in a
 * subdirectory is never read, so a tree ignored only from there is invisible to
 * git and fully visible to Prettier.
 *
 * `kb/.gitignore` ignores the generated `content/`, `public/`, and
 * `resources/_gen/` trees. Without this, `npm run format:check` walks straight
 * into them — warning on generated markdown once `build:kb-content` has run,
 * then failing outright with a `SyntaxError` on Hugo's minified HTML once
 * `build:kb` has. The command's result would depend on
 * what had been built rather than on what had been written.
 *
 * The fix is to restate each such tree in `.prettierignore`, and this is what
 * keeps it restated: a new nested ignore rule fails here until it is.
