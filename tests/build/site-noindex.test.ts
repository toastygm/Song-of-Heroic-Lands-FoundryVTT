 * indexed and compete with the canonical URL. The deployment carries a
 * `_headers` file that marks those addresses `noindex`.

 * uploaded — Cloudflare Pages reads `_headers` from the **root** of the
 * deployment, so a rule written anywhere else is silently inert. The response
 * headers themselves are checked against the running deploy, at both addresses,
