/**
 * The run record follows the **act**, not the offer.
 *
 * `system.lastRun[shortcode]` records "the world time that action last
 * *performed* on this document". Under the Check/Test split a `*Check`
 * only posts a card inviting one test — it rolls nothing and changes nothing —
 * so stamping the record there answered "when was the offer posted?", and said
 * the check had happened even when the player never touched the card. The
 * `*Test` is what performs, so it is what records.
 *
 * These are structural assertions over the action definitions; the stamping
 * mechanism itself is covered in `Action.test.ts`.
