/**
 * These used to test `phaseFields(name)` and `durationFields(name)` — generators
 * that built their keys from a template literal. The generators are gone: a
 * field name assembled from an argument exists only once the argument is
 * applied, so it is not in the source, and `package-build schema` — which reads
 * these models as data rather than running them — could not name any of the
 * fourteen fields they produced. Content authoring `system.onsetDate` would have
 * been told no DataModel declares it.
 *
 * So the assertion moved to the thing that regressed: the **published schema**.
 * That is a stronger claim than the generator's key naming ever was — it is
 * what other repositories actually read — and it needs no Foundry stubs, where
 * importing the DataModel classes pulls in a chain that does.
 *
 * `npm run lint:schema` separately guarantees this file still matches the
 * source, so asserting on it is not asserting on a stale copy.
