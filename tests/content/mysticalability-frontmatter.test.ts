/**
 * What a `mysticalability` content note is allowed to say.
 *
 * A key a note authors under `sohl:` that no `MysticalAbilityDataModel` field
 * receives is discarded by Foundry when the compendium item is constructed —
 * silently, with nothing at compile or load time to tell the author their
 * value had no effect. `assocMysteryCode` was exactly that for nine notes
 * The DataModel does not declare it, so a note must not set it.
 *
 * This is the copy-side guard. It cannot see the pack builder's emitted block
 * (that lives in `@heroiclands/package-build`, and is
 * the toolchain), but it does keep the notes in this repository
 * honest about the schema they are authored against.
