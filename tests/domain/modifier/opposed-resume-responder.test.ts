/**

 * button's handler.
 *
 * `MasteryLevelModifier.opposedTestResume` is called on the mastery level of the
 * skill or attribute the defender picked, so that modifier is what the target's
 * d100 must be measured against. It used to branch on
 * `if (!opposedTestResult.targetTestResult)` — a condition the `OpposedTestResult`
 * constructor makes permanently false, since it always materializes a
 * placeholder target side. Every Respond therefore fell into the "GM is
 * modifying" branch, which reused that placeholder (carrying an **empty**
 * modifier) and drove it with the *source's* mastery level.
 *
 * The discriminator is now "has the target side actually rolled?", and both
 * paths run against `this` — the responder's own modifier.
