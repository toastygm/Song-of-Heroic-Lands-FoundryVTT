/**
 * Drag-reordering skills on the Being sheet.
 *
 * A skill's group comes from its subType, never from where it was dropped, so a
 * cross-group drag clamps to the near edge of the skill's own group instead of
 * re-parenting. That rule is pure, and is asserted here; the DOM wiring is
 * covered by `cypress/e2e/skill-dragdrop.cy.js`.
