/**
 * `system.templatePriority` — the Create-dialog archetype
 * marker, moved off `flags.sohl.docArchetype` and into the schema so it can be
 * authored on a sheet instead of by export / hand-edit / re-import, then
 * renamed off `archetype` so that word is free for the character-sort taxonomy.
 *
 * Two different claims are asserted here.
 *
 * - **It is published on every subtype.** `schema.json` is what other
 *   repositories actually read — `@heroiclands/package-build`'s
 *   emitted-versus-declared check, and the satellite content trees that author
 *   the field. An undeclared `system` key is discarded silently at
 *   construction, so this has to be checked against the artifact rather than
 *   against the source it was generated from. `npm run lint:schema` separately
 *   guarantees the artifact is not stale, so asserting on it is not asserting
 *   on a stale copy.
 * - **It is declared once, with the right options.** `schema.json` records
 *   field _names_, not field options, so the `nullable` / `integer` /
 *   `initial: null` triple is asserted against the source of
 *   `defineSohlDataSchema()`. It is read as text rather than imported for the
 *   same reason `temporal-fields.test.ts` reads the artifact: importing the
 *   DataModel classes pulls in a circular Foundry-coupled chain.
