# Build, Deployment, and Release

Everything you need to take Song of Heroic Lands (SoHL) from a fresh clone to a
running Foundry instance and a published release: environment setup, every npm
script, how the build pipeline works, the layout of the `build/` directory,
compendium packs from in-repo Markdown, deploying to a Foundry instance, and the
release process. **Manual steps are called out explicitly** with a 🔧 marker.

> Audience: maintainers and contributors working on the SoHL system itself. For
> the rules of contributing, see
> [System Development](../contributing/system-development.md).

## 1. First-time setup

🔧 **Prerequisites:** **Node.js ≥ 24** (see `engines` in `package.json`) and
**Git** — that's all you need to build and test. Deploying to a Foundry instance
may need extra access depending on the target (for example, SSH for a remote host).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HeroicLands/Song-of-Heroic-Lands-FoundryVTT.git
cd Song-of-Heroic-Lands-FoundryVTT
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # then edit — see below
npm ci                             # clean install from package-lock.json → node_modules/
npm run build                      # full build into build/stage/
```

🔧 **`.env.local`** (gitignored — each developer keeps their own) holds the Foundry
paths that drive deployment. You only need it when deploying to a Foundry instance;
[§6 Deploying to a Foundry instance](#6-deploying-to-a-foundry-instance) lists
every variable and what it's for.

See the file **`.gitignore`** for the specifics of which files are local only
and not stored in the repo. In particular, if you create a `nogit` folder,
anything inside of it will be ignored. If you use VSCode or IntelliJ, those
IDE configurations will also be ignored.

## 2. npm scripts

Every script in `package.json`, grouped by purpose. `run-s` runs steps in
sequence; `run-p` runs them in parallel.

### Build

| Script                | What it does                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build`               | Full production build: `npm ci` then `build:noci`. The canonical "build it all" entry.                                                             |
| `build:local`         | Same as `build` but `npm i` (allows lockfile updates) instead of `npm ci`.                                                                         |
| `build:noci`          | The pipeline without install: `lint:format → lint:docs-index → build:types → lint:dts → build:prepare → test:coverage → test:purity → build:code`. |
| `build:prepare`       | In parallel: `build:css`, `build:db`, `build:system`.                                                                                              |
| `build:types`         | TypeScript type-check / compile (`tsc -p tsconfig.json`). No emit beyond `.d.ts`/checking.                                                         |
| `build:css`           | Compile `scss/sohl.scss` → `build/stage/css/sohl.css` (Sass).                                                                                      |
| `build:system`        | Generate `build/stage/system.json` from `package-build.config.yaml` (`package-build manifest`).                                                    |
| `build:assets`        | Copy `templates/`, `lang/`, `assets/*`, `LICENSE.md`, `README.md` into `build/stage/` (`package-build assets`).                                    |
| `build:db`            | `build:assets` then `build:compiledb` — stage assets, then compile packs.                                                                          |
| `build:compiledb`     | Generate JSON from `assets/content/` Markdown, then compile LevelDB packs in `build/stage/packs/`.                                                 |
| `build:unpackdb`      | The reverse: unpack the staged LevelDB packs back to JSON (for inspection).                                                                        |
| `build:code`          | Bundle the system with Vite (`vite build --mode release`) → `build/stage/sohl.js`.                                                                 |
| `build:icons`         | Rebuild the icon font from SVGs (`utils/build-icon-font.mjs`). Run by hand when icons change.                                                      |
| `build:icon-legend`   | Regenerate the user guide's Icon Legend page from `src/` + `lang/en.json` (`utils/build-icon-legend.mjs`). Verified by `lint:icon-legend`.         |
| `build:kb-content`    | Generate the site's Markdown: `assets/content/` + `kb/dev-docs/` → `kb/content/kb/` (`content-build site`). No Hugo needed.                        |
| `build:kb`            | `build:kb-content` then render it with Hugo → `build/site/sohl/`. Needs Hugo and the theme submodule.                                              |
| `site:assemble`       | Mount the TypeDoc HTML at `build/site/sohl/api/` and finish the deployable tree (`utils/build-site.mjs`).                                          |
| `build:site`          | The whole of `/sohl/`: `docs:prepare → docs:html → build:kb → site:assemble`.                                                                      |
| `build:pack-release`  | Zip `build/stage/` → `build/dist/system.zip` and copy `system.json` (`package-build release`).                                                     |
| `clean` / `distclean` | Remove build output (`distclean` also clears caches/`node_modules`-level artifacts).                                                               |

### Compendium packs

| Script            | What it does                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build:compiledb` | Generate each pack's per-entry JSON from the `assets/content/` Markdown into `build/packs-json/<pack>/`, then compile LevelDB from it. |
| `build:unpackdb`  | Extract a compiled LevelDB pack back to per-entry JSON under `build/tmp/packs/`.                                                       |

The authoritative content is the in-repo Markdown under `assets/content/`; the
JSON is a disposable `build/` intermediate. `build:compiledb` reads the Markdown
directly — nothing stands between the note you edit and the pack that ships.

#### Scene ↔ Level integrity

`build:compiledb` reads each pack **back off disk** after writing it and fails the
build if a Scene has lost its embedded `Level`.

A v14 Scene keeps its map image on a `Level`, and a compiled pack stores the two
under separate LevelDB keys — the Scene at `!scenes!<id>` holding `levels` as an
array of ids, each Level at `!scenes.levels!<sceneId>.<levelId>`. Nothing in
Foundry ties them together on read. A missing Level record only produces a
warning (`N embedded levels records in Level <id> were undefined and not
retrieved from the scenes.levels sublevel`), after which the collection reads as
empty; the next world launch migrates that Scene and **persists `levels: []`**,
leaving `initialLevel` dangling. The map image is then gone for good, and the
only symptom is a blank battlemap. That is measured behaviour on both 14.359 and
14.367 — the core is not at fault, but the condition is unobservable until it is
permanent.

The check therefore runs against the compiled bytes rather than the JSON they
came from, because the gap it closes is the _write_ path: the emitter is already
unit-tested, whereas the compendium CLI has previously mishandled Scene Levels.
An `Adventure` carries its scenes inline, levels and all, so that second shape is
checked too. The rule itself is a pure function (`@heroiclands/package-build/engine/scene-levels`)
and is unit-tested directly.

### Tests, lint, format

| Script                    | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test`                    | Run the vitest suite once.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `test:watch` / `test:ui`  | Watch mode / the vitest UI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `test:coverage`           | Run with coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `test:purity`             | The Foundry-free purity check (`vitest.purity.config.ts`).                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `e2e:full`                | _(on demand)_ The Cypress integration suite against a licensed Foundry container — not part of CI. See [Testing](testing.md).                                                                                                                  |
| `lint` / `lint:fix`       | ESLint over `src/` (with `--fix`).                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `lint:docs-index`         | Fail if a `docs/` page is missing from its section nav or the README.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `lint:addresses`          | Fail on a malformed `shortcode` or a duplicate `(type, shortcode)` in `assets/content/`. Runs `content-build lint`, so the rules are the toolchain's. See [Shortcode Integrity](../reference/shortcode-integrity.md).                          |
| `lint:rules-vtt`          | Fail if a rules document under `assets/content/Rules/` describes the VTT — clicks, buttons, dialogs, the chat log, or "the system". See [Authoring content notes](#authoring-content-notes).                                                   |
| `lint:content-links`      | Fail on a `#anchor` link in `assets/content/` that no heading declares, or a `Rules/**` document unreachable from the rules root. See [Authoring content notes](#authoring-content-notes).                                                     |
| `lint:doc-links`          | Fail on a relative link in `kb/dev-docs/` whose target does not exist, or an `#anchor` no heading declares. The developer tree links by path, so moving a page breaks every link into it; this is what says so.                                |
| `lint:styles`             | stylelint over `scss/`. Enforces the BEM class convention and the `--sohl-*` token namespace, plus invalid declarations, unknown properties, and dead selectors. See [What the two linters check](#what-the-two-linters-check).                |
| `lint:markdown`           | markdownlint over every git-tracked `.md` file. A deliberately narrow structural set — heading hierarchy, duplicate sibling anchors, broken table rows, links that do not link. See [What the two linters check](#what-the-two-linters-check). |
| `lint:icon-legend`        | Fail if `assets/content/User_Guide/Icon_Legend.md` differs from what `build:icon-legend` would write — the page is generated, so a hand-edit to it is lost on the next run (#1620).                                                            |
| `lint:expr-scopes`        | Fail if the generated expression-scope table in [Expressions and Scripts](../concepts/expressions.md) is out of date with `src/entity/expr/expression-scopes.mjs`. Regenerate with `npm run docs:expr-scopes`.                                 |
| `lint:dts`                | Validate the generated public type surface.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `lint:bundle-globals`     | Fail if `system.json` loads `sohl.js` as a classic script while the bundle declares names at global scope. Needs a built stage — runs after `build:code`, not inside `lint`.                                                                   |
| `lint:format`             | Prettier `--check` over the repo — the same check as `format:check`, wired into the `lint` chain so drift fails the build (#1621).                                                                                                             |
| `format` / `format:check` | Prettier write / check the whole repo.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

#### How a linter reports a finding

Every finding a `utils/check-*.mjs` linter emits is a single line in the form
every C-family compiler, `tsc` and ESLint already use, so an editor's error
matcher, a CI annotator or a `grep` resolves it without being told anything
about this repository (#1668):

```text
assets/content/Rules/Attributes.md:28:13: error: dead address [[doc-nosuchthing]] — no document has that identity
```

`file:line:column: severity: message`, unindented, one finding per line. The
path is relative to the repository root. The layout is written in exactly one
place, and that place is **not this repository** — `formatDiagnostic` lives in
`@heroiclands/package-build` (`engine/diagnostics`), so the content build's note
warnings and these linters' findings cannot drift into two dialects of the same
form. Each linter imports `emitDiagnostic` from there directly and never formats
its own; where it needs to point at a literal in a file that is not a parsed
note — source, docs, lang files, e2e specs — it imports `positionOfLiteral`
from the same module.

There is no local re-export barrel in between. There was one, and it earned
nothing: ten of its thirteen consumers took a single symbol from it, so it saved
no import line, while renaming `emitDiagnostic` to `reportDiagnostic` — which
meant grepping this repository for the real name found nothing at all.

Two rules make it dependable:

- **The path starts the line.** A finding is never indented and never prefixed.
  Leading whitespace alone puts it outside what a standard error matcher reads,
  which is what the old `  <file>:<line>: …` form did.
- **A field is dropped, never guessed.** A linter reports the position it can
  establish honestly and no more — `file:line: …` where the column is
  meaningless, `file: …` where only the file is known. Nothing defaults to
  `1:1`, which would send a reader to the top of the file every time.

Where a finding is _about_ a literal the linter matched — a wikilink, a
hardcoded caption, a `TODO` marker, a lang key — its position is recovered with
`locateInText`, which also takes an occurrence number, so two identical findings
in one file are reported at their own columns rather than both at the first.
Where a finding is a property of the whole file — a stale generated page, a
missing barrel, an unreachable document — the file alone is the honest locator
and no position is invented.

Summary counts and the explanatory paragraph each linter prints after its
findings are **not** findings, and keep their prose form.

#### What the two linters check

Prettier formats ~96% of the hand-written text in this repository, and formatting
is all it does. `lint:styles` and `lint:markdown` (#1622) exist for the checks it
structurally cannot make — and each is scoped to **exactly** that, because both
tools ship defaults that would otherwise re-format the tree to a second opinion.
`stylelint.config.mjs` carries the per-rule rationale for the first; the
markdown rules are **shared**, and their rationale lives with them in
`@heroiclands/package-build` (`engine/prose-config.mjs`), because every content
repository in the project is authored against the same set (#20). The rule of
thumb for adding a rule to either is whether it can report that something is
**wrong**, not that it is spelled differently.

**`lint:styles` (stylelint + `stylelint-config-standard-scss`).** The gate that
matters most is naming, because the stylesheets carry a public extension surface:
[CSS Architecture](../concepts/css-architecture.md) tells module authors to build
against the `--sohl-*` custom properties, and §3 fixes SoHL's class names to BEM.
Neither had a guard before, so a rename was an API break nobody could see.

- `selector-class-pattern` — BEM `block__element--modifier` (§3). The pattern also
  admits the Foundry-owned classes SoHL selects on, which are plain kebab-case
  blocks. Third-party names that are not (`.ProseMirror`) are disabled at the one
  site, with the reason, rather than widened into the pattern.
- `custom-property-pattern` — lowercase kebab-case everywhere, tightened to the
  `--sohl-*` namespace inside `scss/abstracts/`, where §4's `emit-tokens` mixin
  declares the tokens. It is deliberately looser outside that folder because the
  rule inspects `var()` references as well as declarations, and SoHL legitimately
  reads Foundry-core properties and its own template-set layout hooks
  (`--ledger-cols`, `--hp-fill`).
- Everything else `stylelint-config-standard-scss` brings — invalid and duplicate
  declarations, unknown properties and units, dead selectors — stays on.

Its **limit**, worth knowing before trusting it: the `--sohl-*` tokens are
generated by interpolation (`--sohl-color-#{$name}`), which stylelint skips as
non-standard syntax. Renaming a key in the `$color` map renames a public token and
no linter here will say so.

Rules that only rewrite a value into an equivalent spelling are **off** —
blank-line placement, `rgb()` notation, `currentcolor` casing, longhand-vs-shorthand.
Satisfying them would mean reflowing 52 hand-written partials for byte-identical
compiled output, which is the cosmetic refactor
[System Development](../contributing/system-development.md) forbids.

**`lint:markdown` (`content-build markdown`).** Enabled on markdownlint's
defaults over 1,600 files it reports ~74,000 findings, essentially all of them
line length, list indentation, and blank lines — Prettier's territory. So
`default` is off and nine rules are named individually:

| Rule            | Catches                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MD001`         | A skipped heading level, which breaks every outline derived from the page |
| `MD024`         | Two identical **sibling** headings — two identical anchors, one reachable |
| `MD056`         | A table row whose cell count does not match its header                    |
| `MD011`         | Reversed link syntax, `(text)[url]`, which renders as plain text          |
| `MD034`         | A bare URL, which only some of our three renderers auto-link              |
| `MD039`/`MD042` | Spaces inside link text; an empty link target                             |
| `MD052`/`MD053` | An undefined reference link; an orphaned reference definition             |

`MD024` runs with `siblings_only` — repeating `## Notes` under several parents is a
normal reference-page shape, and only a repeat within one parent is ambiguous.
`gitignore: true` keeps the generated trees out (`kb/content/`, `kb/public/`,
`build/`, `nogit/`); `CHANGELOG.md` is excluded by the shared configuration,
since `changeset version` regenerates it in every repository here, and the theme
submodule by `.markdownlint-cli2.mjs` — which is all that file holds. It spreads
the shared configuration and adds `kb/themes`, because a submodule that lints
itself in its own repository is knowledge about _this_ repository's layout and
nothing shared can know it. The same split applies to Prettier:
`.prettierignore` stays here, the rules do not.

Note what is **not** here: `MD018` (`#Heading` with no space) reads a line starting
`#1405) …` as a malformed heading, and this repository writes bare issue numbers
constantly. `MD051` (link fragments resolve) is already covered, and covered
better — across files rather than within one — by `lint:doc-links` and
`lint:content-links`.

### Docs

| Script                      | What it does                                                                                                          |

| `docs:prepare`              | `docs:catalog` (generate the type catalog) + `docs:expr-scopes` (generate the expression-scope table).                |
| `docs:expr-scopes`          | Regenerate the bound-variables table in [Expressions and Scripts](../concepts/expressions.md) from the scope catalog. |

| `docs:serve` / `docs:watch` | Serve `build/docs-html` / rebuild-and-serve on change.                                                                |

| `check:sohl-types`                         | `build:sohl-types`, then type-check it as a consumer would and validate the bundle. Gated in CI.    |

## 3. The build pipeline

`npm run build` runs `npm ci` then `build:noci`, which is:

1. **`lint:format`** — Prettier reports no drift anywhere in the repo.
2. **`lint:docs-index`** — every `docs/` page is linked from its section nav and the README.
   `lint` also runs `lint:markdown` and `lint:styles` here; see
   [What the two linters check](#what-the-two-linters-check).
3. **`build:types`** — `tsc` type-checks the whole project.
4. **`lint:dts`** — the generated public type surface is valid.
5. **`check:sohl-types`** — `@heroiclands/sohl-types` regenerates, type-checks
   from a consumer's position, and passes `utils/check-sohl-types.mjs`
   (see [The npm workspace package](#the-npm-workspace-package)).
6. **`build:prepare`** (parallel):
   - **`build:css`** — Sass → `build/stage/css/sohl.css`.
   - **`build:db`** — copy assets, then compile packs to `build/stage/packs/`.
   - **`build:system`** — write `build/stage/system.json`.
7. **`test:coverage`** and **`test:purity`** — the suite must pass.
8. **`build:code`** — Vite bundles `src/sohl.ts` → `build/stage/sohl.js` (single ES
   module, sourcemap, unminified, with `emptyOutDir: false` so it doesn't wipe the
   staged CSS/assets/packs).
9. **`lint:bundle-globals`** — the manifest loads the bundle the way it was built.

The result is a complete, deployable system in **`build/stage/`**.

### The bundle is an ES module — the manifest must say so

`sohl.js` is built as an **ES module**, so `system.json` lists it under
**`"esmodules"`**. That is not a stylistic choice, and the two must never drift
apart: listing it under `"scripts"` makes Foundry load the same file as a
**classic script**, which changes where its top-level declarations live.

- In a module, every top-level `const`/`let`/`class` is **module-scoped** —
  private to the bundle.
- In a classic script, those declarations become **global lexical** bindings. One
  whose name matches a _non-configurable_ property of `window` throws
  `SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared` at **parse time**,
  before any of the system runs — so the whole system fails to load.

Bundled dependencies really do declare such names: `@codemirror/view` (inlined for
the SafeExpression editor) declares `const chrome`, and `style-mod` declares
`const top`. `window.chrome` is `configurable: false` and `window.top` is
`[Unforgeable]`, so under `"scripts"` either one is fatal. The release build is
deliberately **unminified**, so these identifiers survive verbatim — Foundry's own
CodeMirror build escapes the problem only because minification renames them.

`npm run lint:bundle-globals` (`package-build bundle check`, part of
`build:noci`) enforces the agreement: it parses the built bundle exactly as a
browser would and fails if `sohl.js` is served as a classic script while declaring
anything at global scope.

```

**`build/stage/` _is_ the system directory.** Its contents are exactly what an
installed `Data/systems/sohl/` looks like — Foundry would load it as-is. Everything
downstream derives from it: the push scripts copy it verbatim into a Foundry data
directory, and `build:pack-release` simply zips its contents into the release
`system.zip`. There is no separate transform step — the staged directory **is** the
system, and `system.zip` is just an archive of it.

**How `system.json` is assembled** (`package-build manifest`): everything it
declares comes from `package-build.config.yaml`. The `packageBuild.manifest`
block is emitted unchanged; `id`, `version`, the four release addresses,
`compatibility` and `packs` are **derived** and may not be declared there; and
`packageBuild.manifestFlags` names `utils/manifest-flags.mjs`, which computes
the `sohl` flag namespace — the credits journal's `@UUID` only exists once the
content tree has been walked.

There is no template. `assets/templates/system.template.json` was retired
(package-build#9): it was the last build input still hand-authored as JSON, and
it declared the pack list, the package id and the Foundry range a second time,
with nothing checking that the two agreed.

## 5. Compendium packs from in-repo Markdown

SoHL ships three compendium packs — **items**, **journals**, **actors** — declared
in the system manifest. Each has a committed JSON source tree at
`assets/packs/<pack>/_source/`, which `build:compiledb` compiles into Foundry's
LevelDB format under `build/stage/packs/<pack>/`.

### Design decision — Markdown in the repository, build-only JSON

The compendium content is **authored in this repository**, under `assets/content/`.
The build compiles that tree directly: `build:compiledb` generates each pack's
per-entry JSON into a disposable `build/packs-json/<pack>/` intermediate and
compiles the LevelDB packs from it, so the JSON is **never committed**.

`assets/content/` is this repository's source and is edited here directly (#1445).
No export feeds it and nothing regenerates it, so a fix belongs in the note.

**Building needs nothing but this repository**: `npm run build`, or
`npm run build:compiledb` for packs only.

Two guards remain, because compiling nothing is still the dangerous case — it
would ship blank compendiums with nothing in the log to say so. The pack build
and `lint:addresses` fail on an empty content **tree**; the pack build also fails on
empty **output**, when a pass compiles zero entries from a tree that is not
empty. That second case is what a wrong package id looks like: every note is
rejected because it declares a package this build does not compile. A pack that
genuinely ships nothing in some consuming package declares `mayBeEmpty: true` on
its entry in `package-build.config.yaml`, rather than the guard being relaxed for
everyone.

Cross-package references are resolved through published link manifests rather
than a shared tree, fetched into a local cache by `content-build deps fetch`. This
repository is the base package and resolves nothing outside itself (#1839); see
[The Link Manifest](../reference/link-manifest.md).

### Authoring content notes

Items, actors, and journal entries are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
(a `type:`, a `shortcode:` — together the address the document's id derives
from — and folder/embedding metadata; the content package is
not authored per note — it is the `contentPackage` declared once in
`package-build.config.yaml`, `sohl` here),
authored anywhere under `assets/content/`.
**Classification is frontmatter-driven, not directory-driven:** a file joins a
pack because of its `type` (item kinds →
the items pack **and**, for its prose, the journals pack; `type: doc` → journals;
`being` → actors), so the
folder layout is for human organization only and can be reorganized freely. Folder
hierarchies are declared per pack in `assets/content/<pack>-folders.yaml` and
referenced from entries via `sohl.folder: <id>`.

#### Choosing a pack: the optional `pack:` field

A repository may ship **more than one pack of a document type** — two Item packs
grouping items editorially, say. Where it does, a note names the one it belongs
in with a top-level `pack:` field:

```yaml
---
name:
  full: Second Sight
type: skill
package: sohl
pack: mysteries # optional; one of the configured Item packs
---
```

`type:` and `pack:` answer different questions and are not interchangeable:
`type:` decides **what the note compiles into** (and therefore which compiler
runs), `pack:` decides **which pack of that type receives it**.

- **The field is optional, and omitting it is the normal case.** A note that
  declares nothing lands in the **default** pack of its type. A type with
  exactly one pack — which is every type in this repository — is its own default,
  so no SoHL note declares a pack and none needs to.
- **A `pack:` naming no configured pack fails the build**, naming the file and
  what it asked for. It does not quietly fall back to the default: a typo that
  landed content in the wrong compendium would be exactly the silent partial
  compilation the pack build's other guards exist to catch.
- **The declaration is about the note's own document.** An item's prose still
  compiles into a JournalEntry in the journals pack; `pack:` says where the
  _item_ goes.
- Where a type has several packs and none is marked `default: true`, the field is
  **mandatory** for every note of that type.

(Why a default exists at all: every note in every consuming repository predates
this field, so silence has to keep meaning "the one pack of my type".)

```bash
# assets/content/ Markdown → build/packs-json/ (JSON) → build/stage/packs/ (LevelDB)
npm run build:compiledb
```

**The rules never describe the VTT.** Content under `assets/content/Rules/` is the
_specification_ the Foundry system implements, and must read as though no VTT
exists — no clicks, buttons, dialogs, chat log, or "the system". A rule that says
"click **Accept** on the card" describes an interface, and goes silently wrong the
moment the interface changes. Automation behaviour — the consent/offer flow, what
is prompted and when — is worth documenting, but its home is
`assets/content/User_Guide/`, which is exempt from the rule. `npm run
lint:rules-vtt` (part of `npm run lint`) enforces this over the rules tree.

**The rules are a book, and its links have to land.** Two link defects survive
both content builds silently, so `npm run lint:content-links` (also part of
`npm run lint`) checks for them:

- **A `#anchor` link that no heading declares.** The journal compiler derives a
  Foundry page id by hashing `"<noteId>-<anchorSlug>"`, so a link to an anchor
  nothing declares compiles cleanly, emits a `@UUID` enricher, and dead-ends for
  the reader. Declare `{#the-anchor}` on the heading the link means, or point the
  link at one that exists.
- **A rules document unreachable from `Rules/_Introduction.md`.** An
  unlinked note still compiles and still publishes; it is simply impossible to
  arrive at by reading. Link each one from the chapter that owns it. The walk
  resolves links exactly as the builds do, and expands fenced `dataview` tables
  first, so a generated row link counts. It stops **at** the glossary rather than
  walking through it: an index links to nearly everything, and following it would
  make the check vacuous.

`build:compiledb` runs the pack CLI, the `content-build` binary the installed
package puts on the path. The CLI owns every side effect — argv parsing, `loglevel` configuration, creating
`build/tmp/packs/`, and the process exit code — and calls the import-safe library
`@heroiclands/package-build/engine/compendiums`, whose `compilePacks` / `unpackPacks` / `cleanPacks`
take every path and pack list as an argument. That split is what lets another
repository's build import the compiler without inheriting a `build/` tree or a
reconfigured logger.

`compilePacks` in turn runs `@heroiclands/package-build/engine/generate`, which
drives one compiler per configured pack (`sohl/items.mjs`, `sohl/actors.mjs`,
`engine/journals.mjs`, `engine/macros.mjs`, `engine/scenes.mjs`): each walks the
content tree, selects files by frontmatter, validates folders against the pack's
`*-folders.yaml`, and writes per-entry JSON — from which the LevelDB is then
compiled.

#### Adding a pack compiler: `BasePackCompiler`

That walk is written **once**, in `@heroiclands/package-build/engine/base-compiler`. Walking the
tree, rejecting notes of another content package, skipping drafts, expanding
generated tables, converting wikilinks, writing the JSON and counting what
failed are identical in every pass, so `BasePackCompiler` owns them and each
pass subclasses it (#1509). A pass states only what makes it that pass:

| Hook                              | What it decides                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `selects(fm)`                     | Which notes this pack claims. **Required.**                      |
| `buildEntry(fm, markdown)`        | One note → one document. **Required.**                           |
| `prepare()`                       | Anything the walk needs first — an index, a prior pack's output. |
| `skipNote(fm, body)`              | A further rejection the type filter cannot express.              |
| `compileNote(fm, markdown)`       | A note that emits _more_ than its own document.                  |
| `onCompiled(fm, doc)`             | Per-note tallies for the summary.                                |
| `finish(stats)`                   | Work that needs every note compiled first.                       |
| `reportCompiled` / `reportDetail` | The pass's own log lines.                                        |

`selects` answers _which document type_ a pass claims, and every pack of that
type gives the same answer. Which **pack of that type** a claimed note lands in
is a second question, answered by the pack router from the note's own `pack:`
declaration — so a subclass never has to know that its type ships in more than
one pack (see [Several packs of one document
type](#several-packs-of-one-document-type)).

Two static switches complete it: `requiresId` (a claimed note with no **address**
to derive an id from is fatal, or merely skipped — the journals pass is the only
one that tolerates it)
and `convertsWikilinks` (whether the body reaching `buildEntry` is converted or
exactly as authored — the macros pass needs the latter, because its `command` is
executable source).

**This is the extension point.** The pack list is data and each entry names a
Foundry document type; a consumer needing a document type the toolchain does not
ship writes a subclass and registers it in `generate.mjs`'s `COMPILERS` map,
rather than copying a pass and editing it. The contract the generator relies on
stays small — construct with `{contentBase, dest, companionDests,
folderResolver, packName, docType, router}`, `await compile()`, read `errorCount`
and `compiledCount`.

`@heroiclands/package-build/engine/map-notes` is deliberately **not** a subclass: it never walks
the tree. It is the pure markdown→`Scene` translator the scenes pass calls, and
keeping it framework-free is what makes it unit-testable.

#### The pack pipeline is configured, not hard-coded

Everything about the pipeline that is _this repository's_ rather than any
consumer's lives in one file at the repository root,
**`package-build.config.yaml`**. Nothing inside the shared package spells a
path, a package name, or a pack list of its own; each module reads the resolved
configuration through `@heroiclands/package-build/engine/pack-config`, which
locates the config file by walking up from itself — so it lands on the consuming
repository's root from `node_modules/` (#1508). A consuming repository —
`sohl-thalorna`, `sohl-kethira-basic`, an adventure module — ships the same
toolchain with its own copy of that file and nothing else.

**The configuration is data, and it is deliberately not code.** Three values a
code config used to compute are derived by the loader instead, so no repository
reproduces them:

| Field                 | Derived from                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rootDir`             | the directory the config file sits in — **authoring it throws**     |
| `stats.systemVersion` | `version` in the adjacent `package.json`, unless stated             |
| `itemBuilders`        | a **name** (`itemBuilders: sohl`), resolved to the shipped registry |

A `package-build.config.mjs` still loads, for a consumer whose item-builder
registry is its own code — data cannot carry functions. Both forms end at the
same `defineConfig`, so both are validated and frozen identically. A directory
holding **both** is an error rather than a precedence question: picking one
would let a repository mid-conversion build from the file nobody is editing.

##### Several packs of one document type

The pack list may hold more than one entry of the same `type`. That is not a
stylistic nicety: a compendium UUID carries its pack name
(`Compendium.<package>.<pack>.Item.<id>`), so a module that ships three Item
packs and later collapses them into one invalidates every reference an existing
world holds. Foundry modules routinely split same-type documents editorially, and
the pipeline has to be able to express that.

```yaml
packs:
    - { name: characteristics, type: Item, default: true }
    { name: "mysteries", type: "Item" },
    { name: "journals", type: "JournalEntry" },
],
```

- `type` selects the **compiler**; the note's `pack:` selects **which pack of
  that type** receives its document. Getting those two confused is the easiest
  mistake to make here — they are orthogonal, and both are needed.
- `default: true` designates the pack of its type that receives notes declaring
  none. At most one per type, enforced by `defineConfig`. A type with exactly one
  pack is its default implicitly, which is what keeps every existing
  one-pack-per-type configuration — including this repository's — valid and
  behaving identically.
- Where a type has several packs and none is marked default, every note of that
  type **must** declare one; an undeclared note fails the build rather than
  guessing.
- A companion pack may not be marked default and may not be named by a note: it
  is written by its parent's pass, and that indirection is the only one the build
  has.

The routing itself is `@heroiclands/package-build/engine/pack-router`, one pure
function over the configured pack list. `BasePackCompiler` consults it for every
note its `selects` claims, so a pass never has to know that its document type
ships in more than one pack. Every pack of a type sees the same notes, so the
**first configured pack of each type** owns the error message for a note of that
type that routes nowhere — one error, named once, rather than one per pack.

Two consequences worth naming, because they are where multi-pack support
actually bites:

- **Links.** Each note's pack is resolved once when the content-wide link index
  is built, and the resolved name is what every emitted `@UUID` carries — so a
  wikilink into the second Item pack addresses that pack, not the first.
- **Embedded items.** The actors pass resolves each being's predefined items
  against **every** Item pack's generated JSON, read as one `(type, shortcode)`
  address space. Two Item packs claiming one address is ambiguous rather than an
  ordering detail, and fails the build.

What it declares:

| Key                                                 | What it settles                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rootDir`                                           | The repository the paths below are resolved against. Absolute (`import.meta.dirname`), so the build reads the same files whatever directory it was launched from.                   |
| `contentPackage` / `foundryPackage` / `packageKind` | Which notes are compiled, which Foundry package ships them, and whether that package is a `systems/` or a `modules/` install.                                                       |
| `stats`                                             | The identity stamped into every compiled document's `_stats` — `systemId`, `systemVersion` (read from `package.json`, not transcribed), `lastModifiedBy`.                           |
| `skipDirectories`                                   | Directory names the content walk ignores (`Templates/`, authoring scaffolding — a convention of this tree, not of the note format).                                                 |
| `paths`                                             | The content root, the manifest-template directory, the vendored link manifests, and the three build outputs. Each defaults to the conventional layout and is relative to `rootDir`. |
| `packs`                                             | The one pack list: name, Foundry document type, folder-hierarchy file, `companions`, `mayBeEmpty`.                                                                                  |

Two properties of that shape are load-bearing:

- **One pack list.** The directories compiled to LevelDB are _derived_ from the
  pack list as `packDirectories` (each pack, then its companions), so the
  compile list and the compiler list cannot drift apart — they used to be two
  separately-maintained arrays that had to agree. The _order_ of that list is
  not load-bearing: each pass declares which document types' compiled output it
  reads, and the build schedules the passes from those declarations.
- **Configuration is the source, and the manifest is generated from it.** That
  arrow used to point the other way: `paths.packageManifest` said where
  `system.template.json` lived, and both the package-id drift guard and the
  compiled packs' `_stats.coreVersion` read out of it. Correct while the
  manifest was hand-authored — a copy in config would have stopped following a
  floor that moves with test evidence, which is the shape defect #1533 had.
  `package-build manifest` generates the manifest now, so there is nothing left
  to follow: the Foundry range is declared here as top-level `compatibility`,
  the guard is deleted (a single source needs no corroboration), and
  `paths.packageManifest` is gone.
  `stats.systemVersion` obeys the same rule from the other side: it is a
  configured value, but the config **reads** it from `package.json` — the file
  Changesets bumps and `build:system` stamps into the manifest — rather than
  transcribing it. Transcribed, it froze at `0.6.0` for four releases, leaving
  every shipped document eligible for migrations it did not need (#1548). It
  stays per-repository rather than moving onto the toolchain because a module
  repository shipping SoHL content declares the version of the _system_ it is
  content for, not its own package version.

The `assets/` root a content note's `img:` resolves to is derived, not written:
`<packageKind>/<foundryPackage>/assets`, so the same note yields
`systems/sohl/assets/…` here and `modules/<id>/assets/…` in a module.

#### Adding or removing an item type

Which `type:` values compile into an Item is declared **once**, in the registry
`@heroiclands/package-build/sohl/item-builders`: `ITEM_BUILDERS` pairs each type with the builder
that produces its `system` block. This repository **names** that registry —
`itemBuilders: sohl` in `package-build.config.yaml`, since data cannot carry
functions — the loader resolves the name to the table, and
`@heroiclands/package-build/engine/item-registry` reads it back out of the
resolved configuration — both the whitelist `itemTypes()` (its key set, which
`@heroiclands/package-build/engine/item-docs` re-exports and assembles
`docEntryTypes()` from) and the `itemBuilder(type)` lookup the Item compiler
dispatches through. So the whitelist of compilable types and the table of
builders are the same object and cannot drift; a type with no builder is not a
type the compiler will accept a note for.

Because both halves are read from configuration, a **consuming repository
supplies its own table** and its notes compile with its own builders — the
compiler dispatched through this package's module-level table until #1563, so a
consumer got the types it asked for and the builders it did not.

Adding a type is therefore one entry in `ITEM_BUILDERS`, its subtype declaration
in `documentTypes.Item` (`packageBuild.manifest` in
`package-build.config.yaml`), and its
default artwork in `@heroiclands/package-build/sohl/default-item-art` — the last
of which the unit
suite holds in exact step with the registry. Removing a type is the same three
deletions. The registry is a **leaf module**: it imports only the frontmatter
readers in `@heroiclands/package-build/engine/frontmatter`, never `helpers.mjs`,
and never the resolved configuration. The config file imports the registry, so a
read back out of configuration there would close a cycle around the config's own
evaluation; the data travels _into_ configuration and only `item-registry.mjs`,
which no config file imports, reads it back out.

### An item's prose compiles to a journal, not into the item

An item note's **body** does not become the item's description. It compiles into
that item's **item doc** — a JournalEntry in the journals pack, in the same
folder and under the same name as the item — and `system.docHtml` becomes
nothing but a `@UUID` link to that entry's first page. The runtime recognises a
description that is only a link as a **pointer** and shows what it points at —
`descriptionLinkTarget()` decides, and Display Description follows. See
`@heroiclands/package-build/engine/item-docs`. A reader of the chat card sees the prose, not a
link.

The prose therefore exists **once**. It used to exist once per item and again on
every actor holding that item — 7.59 MB across the actors pack, of which 133 KB
was distinct text, so a typo fixed in an item description left 57 stale copies on
a single character. Nothing about the actors pass changed: it still embeds the
item wholesale, and what it embeds is now a link.

Two passes have to agree on the link without either seeing the other's output,
which they do by deriving both ids from the item's own document id — itself
derived from the note's address — the technique `anchorPageId()` already uses to
let a section link and its page agree:

|                 | Items pass                        | Journals pass             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Entry id        | `itemDocEntryId(noteDocId(fm))`   | same                      |
| First page id   | `journalPageId(entryId, page, 0)` | same, for every page      |
| Splits the body | to name page 0                    | into the pages themselves |

Both split the **converted** markdown, so an H1 carrying a wikilink names the
same page on both sides. An item note with an empty body gets no entry and an
empty description, rather than a pointer to nothing.

#### Linking to an item's documentation: the `doc<type>` qualifier

> Authoring a link rather than changing the build? Read
> [Linking Between Content Notes](../content-creator/content-links.md) instead — this
> section is the mechanism behind it.

Because the item and its prose are now **two documents in two packs**, they need
two addresses:

| Wikilink                     | Addresses                                           |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `[[skill/wpnc]]`             | the Skill **Item**, in the items pack               |
| `[[docskill/wpnc]]`          | that skill's **JournalEntry**, in the journals pack |
| `[[docskill/wpnc#crafting]]` | the `{#crafting}` **page** of that entry            |

Every item type has a virtual `doc<type>` counterpart. It is formed by prefix
and never enumerated, so a type added tomorrow is addressable the day it is
authored — the same rule that keeps `packForType()` free of a hand-maintained
list. A real content type of the same name always wins; the virtual reading is
consulted only for a qualifier no authored note claims.

**An anchor on an Item, an Actor or a Macro is a no-op** and is dropped. It is
worth being clear why: a `@UUID` to a JournalEntry opens the journal — at its
first page, or at the page an anchor names — whereas a `@UUID` to an Item or an
Actor opens that document's **sheet**, not its documentation. A sheet has no
sections, so there is nothing for an anchor to address. Reaching a page of an
item's documentation is exactly what `doc<type>` is for; before it existed, such
a link compiled to a `JournalEntryPage` id under the _items_ pack and dead-ended
(#1362).

**The knowledgebase reads the same link differently, by design.** There an item
note renders as one page which _is_ its documentation, so `doc<type>` and
`<type>` are aliases for the same URL and the anchor stays an ordinary in-page
anchor. One authored link, correct in both builds.

## 6. Deploying to a Foundry instance

The push scripts copy the staged system into a Foundry data directory:

```bash
npm run deploy:qa      # build, then push:qa   (build + copy in one step)
npm run push:qa        # copy build/stage/ only (no rebuild)
```

The Foundry paths that drive deployment live in **`.env.local`** (copy it from
`.env.local.example`). Use **absolute paths only** — `$HOME` and `~` are not
expanded. A `*_DATA` value may be either:

- a **local path** (e.g. `/Users/me/fvtt/data`) — deployed with an intrinsic
  Node file copy, or
- a **remote SFTP target** (`[user@]host:/path`) — deployed over SFTP via
  `ssh2-sftp-client`, a pure-JS SSH client (no `ssh` binary required). By
  default the running **SSH agent** is used — `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` on macOS/Linux,
  or the OpenSSH named pipe on Windows automatically — so if `ssh host` already
  works no extra config is needed. No password or passphrase is read from
  `.env.local` (for an encrypted key, load it into the agent with `ssh-add`).
  Per-stage overrides exist for username, port, agent endpoint
  (`..._AGENT=pageant` for PuTTY), and a key-file path that skips the agent
  entirely — see the comments in `.env.local.example`.

Either way the push is a **full mirror**: the destination
`Data/systems/sohl/` is cleared and rewritten so it ends up an exact copy of
`build/stage/` (stale files are removed). SFTP has no delta transfer, so a
remote push re-uploads the whole staged build each time.

| Variable                                               | Used for                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FOUNDRYVTT_DEV_DATA`                                  | The Foundry **user-data root** for the **dev** environment. `npm run push:dev` deploys `build/stage/` into `<root>/Data/systems/sohl/` — the `Data/systems/sohl/` suffix is appended automatically. |
| `FOUNDRYVTT_QA_DATA`                                   | The user-data root for **QA**, used by `npm run push:qa`.                                                                                                                                           |
| `FOUNDRYVTT_PROD_DATA`                                 | The user-data root for **production**, used by `npm run push:prod`.                                                                                                                                 |
| `FOUNDRYVTT_DEV` / `FOUNDRYVTT_QA` / `FOUNDRYVTT_PROD` | The Foundry **application install** path for each environment (recorded for convenience; the deploy step uses the `*_DATA` roots above).                                                            |

Point each `*_DATA` variable at the Foundry **user-data directory** (the one that
contains `Data/`), not at `systems/` — the deploy appends the rest.

🔧 **Manual steps around a deploy:**

- Stop (or at least be ready to reload) Foundry — a running server can hold file
  locks and won't pick up code changes until reloaded.
- After the deploy completes, **reload/restart** Foundry to load the new system.
- The first time you use it in a world, select **SoHL** as the world's game system.

### Running a build in a container

To smoke-test a build in a real Foundry instance without maintaining a
hand-run server, `container:<stage>` runs Foundry in Docker against the same
`FOUNDRYVTT_<STAGE>_DATA` root the push scripts deploy into:

```bash
npm run build && npm run push:dev && npm run container:dev start   # bring it up
npm run container:dev stop                                          # tear it down
```

The commands (`package-build container <stage> <command>`):

| Command    | Effect                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`    | Create (or restart) `sohl-foundry-<stage>` and serve `/data`. Sweeps a stale lock first when the container is down. |
| `stop`     | Stop the container (state is kept for a fast `start`).                                                              |
| `restart`  | Stop, sweep a stale lock, start. Deliberately **not** `docker restart`, which leaves no window in which to sweep.   |
| `recreate` | Remove and re-create the container so changed `FOUNDRY_*`/`CONTAINER_*` env applies.                                |
| `rm`       | Stop and remove the container.                                                                                      |
| `status`   | Show the container's `docker ps -a` row.                                                                            |
| `logs`     | Follow the container log (watch first-run install / boot here).                                                     |
| `pull`     | Pull the latest image.                                                                                              |

**The data-root lock.** Foundry takes `Config/options.json.lock` while it runs
and releases it on a clean shutdown. A container that dies holding it (`docker
kill`, a crash, an OOM) strands the lock, and every later boot then fails with
"this directory is already locked by another process" — an error naming no
owner, so it reads like corruption rather than litter. Every command here that
boots Foundry (`start`, `restart`, `recreate`) sweeps the lock first, which is
safe precisely because each does so while the container is stopped: with nothing
running against the data root, a lock present is by definition stale. You should
never need to delete it by hand.

The data root is bind-mounted at `/data`, so the system pushed to
`<root>/Data/systems/sohl/` is served directly — the value **must be a local
path** (a remote SFTP target can't be mounted and is rejected). Foundry itself
runs from the community [`felddy/foundryvtt`](https://hub.docker.com/r/felddy/foundryvtt)
image, which downloads the correct build inside the container (a local Foundry
install can't be reused across platforms — its bundled native modules are
platform-specific).

Configuration lives in `.env.local` (all optional):

| Variable                     | Default                | Purpose                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FOUNDRYVTT_CONTAINER_IMAGE` | `felddy/foundryvtt:14` | Image tag to run (the major is derived from `compatibility.minimum`). |
| `FOUNDRYVTT_<STAGE>_VERSION` | `test` → `14.359`      | Exact build, passed to felddy as `FOUNDRY_VERSION` (see below).       |
| `FOUNDRYVTT_<STAGE>_PORT`    | 30000 / 30001 / 30002  | Published host port (distinct per stage so all three can coexist).    |
| `FOUNDRYVTT_CACHE`           | —                      | Host dir with a pre-downloaded Foundry zip (see cache note below).    |
| `FOUNDRY_*` / `CONTAINER_*`  | —                      | Passed through to the image (licensing, cache, tuning — see below).   |

🔧 **The `test` stage's Foundry build is `compatibility.minimum` itself** — read
from the top level of `package-build.config.yaml` and passed to felddy as
`FOUNDRY_VERSION`, so it downloads that exact build rather than the newest of the
`:14` tag. That is what makes the e2e suite reproducible: without it the test
container drifts to whatever the floating tag serves, and "the suite passes"
names no particular Foundry. No other stage is pinned — `dev`/`qa`/`prod` are
the maintainer's own instances.

Deriving the pin from the claim means there is **one** number, not two that can
drift: `compatibility.minimum` is the oldest Foundry the system claims to
support, and therefore the claim the suite exists to defend. Testing above the
floor would leave the promised configuration unverified, so the newest release is
covered by a periodic **sweep** rather than by the default:

```bash
npm run e2e:sweep -- 14.367     # full suite against the newest release
```

Run it roughly weekly and before shipping; it takes the build as an argument and
has no default, so it cannot rot into a second pinned version. A green sweep is
what licenses moving `compatibility.verified` — which names the newest build the
full suite has **actually passed**, never an aspiration.

`FOUNDRYVTT_<STAGE>_VERSION` in `.env.local` overrides the committed default for
any run. Raising the committed pin, by contrast, is a decision to **raise the
supported floor**: move the top-level `compatibility.minimum` in
`package-build.config.yaml` with it. See
[Testing → Which build the suite runs on](testing.md#which-build-the-suite-runs-on--the-two-tracks).

🔧 **First-run licensing.** felddy needs to fetch Foundry once. Supply your
Foundry credentials (`FOUNDRY_USERNAME` / `FOUNDRY_PASSWORD` [+ `FOUNDRY_LICENSE_KEY`]),
a timed `FOUNDRY_RELEASE_URL`, or a pre-seeded cache (below) — whichever you
prefer, in `.env.local`. The download is cached, so subsequent `start`s are fast
and need no credentials. Docker must be installed and on `PATH`.

**Env is baked in at create time.** `FOUNDRY_*`/`CONTAINER_*` values are fixed
when the container is first created (`docker run`); `start`/`restart` do **not**
pick up changes to them. After editing one — e.g. `FOUNDRY_WORLD=<world-dir>` to
auto-launch a specific world (felddy regenerates `Config/options.json` from the
env on each start, so hand-editing it won't stick), or credentials — run
`npm run container:<stage> recreate` to re-create the container with the current
environment.

**Download cache.** `CONTAINER_CACHE` in felddy is a path **inside the
container** (default `/data/container_cache`). Because the data root is mounted
at `/data`, that default is `<dataRoot>/container_cache/` on your host — so the
no-config option is to drop `foundryvtt-<version>.zip` (e.g.
`foundryvtt-14.364.zip`) there. If instead the zip lives in a **separate** host
directory, set `FOUNDRYVTT_CACHE` to it: the script bind-mounts that directory
and sets `CONTAINER_CACHE` to the mount point for you. Do **not** set a raw
`CONTAINER_CACHE` to a host path — it names a container path and is not
forwarded (use `FOUNDRYVTT_CACHE` instead).

## 7. Cutting a release

A release is cut by **merging the auto-generated "Version Packages" PR**; the
`Version and Release` GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
does the build, tag, GitHub Release, and asset upload. The only command you
type by hand is the docs-deploy dispatch at the end.

### While developing

Every `feat`/`bug` PR carries a changeset (see
[Writing Changesets](../contributing/writing-changesets.md)):

```bash
npm run changeset   # choose the version bump, write the summary
# then commit the generated .changeset/*.md with your PR
```

These accumulate on `main` as PRs merge.

### To cut the release (maintainer)

1. Make sure every change you want in the release is merged to `main`, each
   with its changeset.
2. On each push to `main`, the workflow opens or updates a PR titled
   **`chore(release): version packages`** — it runs `changeset version` to bump
   `package.json` and rewrite `CHANGELOG.md`. Review it (the version and changelog
   are the release).
3. 🔧 **Merge that PR** — in the GitHub UI, or from the CLI (the changesets
   action opens it from the `changeset-release/main` branch):

   ```bash
   gh pr merge changeset-release/main [--admin] --squash --delete-branch
   ```

   Merging _is_ the release — there's nothing else to run locally. The workflow
   re-runs on the merge, sees a new untagged version, and automatically:
   - runs `npm run build` then `npm run build:pack-release`,
   - creates the `v<version>` git tag and a **GitHub Release**,
   - attaches `system.zip` + `system.json` (the manifest/download Foundry installs
     and updates from).

4. **`/sohl/` republishes itself.** The release job dispatches
   `deploy-sohl.yml`, which rebuilds the whole subtree — landing page,
   knowledgebase, and the API documentation from the newest release tag — and
   deploys it. Nothing to run; see [§8](#8-publishing-the-sohl-website). If
   that run fails, repeat it with `gh workflow run deploy-sohl.yml` (it needs
   no arguments — the newest release is always what it documents).

That's the entire release. Two notes:

- `npm run deploy:release` only builds the release zip **locally** (into
  `build/dist/`) for inspection — it does **not** publish anything. Releasing
  always goes through the merge-the-PR flow above.
- A push to `main` with no pending changesets whose version is already tagged does
  nothing — ordinary merges never release.

### The npm workspace package

`packages/` holds one published npm package, **hand-versioned** in its own
`package.json` and independent of the system version:

| Package                   | What it is                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@heroiclands/sohl-types` | Type declarations for authoring modules and macros against SoHL in TypeScript. |

`@heroiclands/package-build` used to live here too. It was extracted to its own
repository (#1589) and publishes from there; this repository now resolves it from
the registry like every other consumer (#1604).

The root `package.json` declares the workspace with

```json
"workspaces": ["packages/*", "."]
```

🔧 **The trailing `"."` is load-bearing, not a typo.** npm does not need it (it
picks the root up regardless), but Changesets discovers packages through the same
`workspaces` globs, and in workspace mode it excludes the root package. Without
`"."` every existing changeset fails with _"Found changeset … for package sohl
which is not in the workspace"_ and the release workflow stops dead. Listing the
root as a workspace keeps `sohl` a package Changesets can version. The one visible
side effect is a `node_modules/sohl` symlink back to the repository root.

It is published by the release workflow through **npm Trusted Publishing**
(OIDC — there is no `NPM_TOKEN`), in a step that is idempotent (it skips a version
already on npm) and `continue-on-error` (Foundry installs from the Release's
`system.zip`, so an npm hiccup must not fail the release). Its `prepack`
regenerates `index.d.ts` at pack time.

⚠️ **`continue-on-error` means the publish step cannot be the thing that tells you
the package is broken.** It swallowed a failing `prepack` for a full release cycle,
so `@heroiclands/sohl-types` quietly stopped being published and nothing went red
(#1613). The generation path is therefore gated by the ordinary build instead —
`build:noci` runs `check:sohl-types` — and that is where a regression must surface.
Keep it there; do not rely on the release job to notice.

Publishing a **new** package needs two one-off maintainer actions that CI cannot
perform: configure a Trusted Publisher for the package name on npmjs.com (pointing
at this repository and `.github/workflows/release.yml`), and make the very first
publish by hand — npm cannot trust a publisher for a package that does not exist
yet.

**At a glance — who does what:**

| Step                          | Manual? | By         |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Author changesets             | 🔧 yes  | developer  |
| Open the Version Packages PR  | no (CI) | —          |
| Merge the Version Packages PR | 🔧 yes  | maintainer |
| Tag + GitHub Release + assets | no (CI) | —          |
| Publish the API docs          | no (CI) | —          |
| Deploy to a Foundry instance  | 🔧 yes  | operator   |

## 8. Publishing the `/sohl/` website

Some of what this repository builds is published to the **web** rather than to a
Foundry instance, and all of it is one site: everything under
`www.heroiclands.org/sohl/`.

| Address      | What                     | Built by                       | Built from             |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `/sohl/`     | The package landing page | Hugo (`kb/layouts/index.html`) | `main`                 |
| `/sohl/kb/`  | The knowledgebase        | Hugo (`build:kb`)              | `main`                 |
| `/sohl/api/` | The API documentation    | TypeDoc (`docs:html`)          | the newest release tag |

`npm run build:site` produces the whole thing locally, and
`.github/workflows/deploy-sohl.yml` produces and deploys it in CI — one build,
one deploy, one hosting project (#1470). A few things about it are worth knowing
before you change any of it.

**It republishes on every push to `main`, and again when a release is
published.** The push trigger carries no path filter: a rebuild is cheap next to
how quietly a path list goes stale, and a push that changes nothing the site
serves simply republishes the same bytes. The second trigger exists because the
API half tracks the newest **release tag**, not `main`, so a freshly published
release changes the site without any push doing so — `release.yml` dispatches
this workflow from the one step that knows it actually cut a release. It is
deliberately _not_ wired to that workflow's _completion_: `release.yml` runs on
every push to `main` and succeeds whether or not it released, so watching it
deployed twice per push (#1484).

**Nothing is purged after a deploy, by design.** `/sohl/` is served through the
routing Worker straight from the Pages project, with Pages' own
`cache-control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` and no `cf-cache-status` —
the zone edge holds nothing under `/sohl/` to invalidate. The `purge_everything`
that used to follow each publish therefore evicted only the surfaces this deploy
never touched (`www`'s own pages, `cdn`). Should a Cache Rule ever cover
`/sohl/`, purge those URLs rather than the zone.

**The deployment carries the `/sohl/` prefix physically.** `publishDir` in
`kb/hugo.toml` renders into `build/site/sohl/`, and the directory that is
uploaded is `build/site/` — so a page's `/sohl/kb/…` link resolves against the
deployment exactly as it will against `www`. That is what lets the hosting
project be checked at its own `*.pages.dev` address before any routing points at
it, and it leaves the routing layer (#1468) a path-preserving pass-through with
nothing to rewrite.

**The hosting project's own address is `noindex`, the canonical path is not.**
A Cloudflare Pages project answers at `<project>.pages.dev` (and at
`<deployment>.<project>.pages.dev` for every deployment) as well as under
`www.heroiclands.org/sohl/`. Nothing advertises it, but it serves the same
pages, so `build/site/_headers` marks those hostnames — and only those —
`X-Robots-Tag: noindex` (#1469). The rules are host-scoped rather than blanket
so the tree stays correct anywhere it is deployed: under its own domain it is
indexable. The hosting cannot tell the routing layer's request apart from a
reader's, since it is the same URL at the same address, so the header reaches
`www` too and the router (`heroiclands-site`, `worker/`) drops it there — the
one place the two addresses are distinguishable. A page that must not be indexed
at _any_ address says so in the document (`<meta name="robots">`), which is
passed through untouched.

**Both surfaces are rebuilt on every run**, even though they track different
refs. A Cloudflare Pages deploy replaces the whole tree, so a run that published
only the half it had rebuilt would take the other half offline. The workflow
therefore builds the knowledgebase from `main`, checks the newest release tag out
into `release/` and builds the API documentation there (with that tag's own
lockfile — the documentation is a pure function of its tag), and
`site:assemble` mounts the result at `build/site/sohl/api/`.

**Nothing ships half-built.** `utils/build-site.mjs` refuses to finish unless
the landing page, the knowledgebase, the API documentation and the `404.html`
are all present — a missing surface would publish a 404 at an address the
navigation already points at, and a missing `404.html` would make Cloudflare
Pages answer unmatched paths with a soft-404 (#1416).

**And nothing ships pointing at a hostname that no longer resolves.** Before it
finishes, the assembler reads every rendered page and fails the build on any
`href` or `src` addressing one of the withdrawn hosts in `RETIRED_HOSTS`
(`utils/retired-hosts.mjs`). Such a link fails at DNS with no redirect to
follow, so it is a hard dead end, and nothing else in the pipeline notices — an
absolute URL is opaque to the wikilink checks. Prose that merely _names_ a
withdrawn host is not reported; these docs explain the move, and saying so is
not a dead end.

The API documentation gets one step first, because the gate alone could never
clear it. It is rebuilt from the newest **release tag**, so a tag cut before a
hostname was withdrawn reproduces the dead links on every deploy however clean
`main` is — which is exactly what `/sohl/api/` was doing (#1487). The assembler
therefore repoints those links, taking a replacement **only when the page it
names is present in the tree it has just assembled**: a repair is verified, never
guessed, because a wrong one would trade a dead end a reader can see for a quiet 404. Candidates come from `rewriteCandidates`, which knows both that the API
site dropped its version segment and that the developer docs now live under
`/dev-docs/`. Anything it cannot rescue falls through to the gate and fails the
build. Every repair is printed: for a current tag the count should be zero, so a
non-zero one means new `src/` JSDoc — or the chrome plugin — has reintroduced a
retired address, and the fix belongs there.

**No layout in this repository names an address.** Every asset resolves through
the theme's `cdn-url.html` against `params.cdnBaseURL`, and every internal link
is built from the page's own `.RelPermalink`, so moving the package or its
artwork is a config edit rather than a sweep through the templates (#1464).
Worth knowing when you add one: with `cdnBaseURL` unset the partial falls back
to `relURL`, so a missing param yields `/sohl/images/…` — a 404 against this
deploy, not a build failure. `kb/hugo.toml` declaring the param is the guard,
not the template.

**Links inside the generated Markdown carry the prefix from the builder, not
from Hugo.** Hugo prefixes what it emits itself (permalinks, assets), but the
wikilinks and cross-references written into `kb/content/` are ordinary site paths
that nothing rewrites afterwards. They are composed from `site.base` (defaulting
to `/<contentPackage>/`), `publish.address.prefix` and `site.passOptions.apiBase`
in `package-build.config.yaml`, which is where a relocation is edited.

**Each page states its own `url`.** A page's address is `(type, shortcode)` and
not the path its file sits at, so the builder writes the address into the
frontmatter rather than letting Hugo derive one from the directory. The build
emits no Hugo `aliases`, and therefore no redirects: an address is stable across
a rename, so there is nothing to redirect from.

## 9. The build utility scripts

The build/deploy/doc tooling lives in **`utils/`**; the pack pipeline is the
shared package **`@heroiclands/package-build`** (#1512), developed in
[its own repository](https://github.com/HeroicLands/content-build) and consumed
here as a `devDependency` from the registry — the same way every other consumer
resolves it (#1589). Each script carries a header comment describing its purpose
and how to invoke it — read the file itself for the authoritative detail. In brief:

| Script                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `manifest-flags.mjs`     | The `flags(config)` hook `package-build manifest` calls: the credits journal's `@UUID`, which only exists once the content tree is walked. |
| `svg-theme.mjs`          | The `transform` hook `package-build assets` calls: recolor each staged SVG so icons follow the Foundry theme.                              |
| `build-icon-font.mjs`    | Build the icon font from SVGs.                                                                                                             |
| `build-type-catalog.mjs` | Generate `kb/dev-docs/reference/type-catalog.md` from the kind enums.                                                                      |
| `docs-coverage.mjs`      | Report doc-comment coverage.                                                                                                               |
| `build-site.mjs`         | Assemble the deployable `/sohl/` tree: mount the API docs, refuse a partial build, and refuse a link to a retired hostname.                |
| `retired-hosts.mjs`      | The withdrawn hostnames and what replaced each — shared by the content-link check and the deploy gate.                                     |
| `release.mjs`            | Legacy local release path; authenticate with `gh auth login` (CI normally cuts releases).                                                  |
| `typedoc-plugin-*.mjs`   | TypeDoc plugins (source categories, nested nav, Foundry links, data-field schema).                                                         |
