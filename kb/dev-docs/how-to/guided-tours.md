# Writing Guided Tours

> **Audience:** SoHL contributors adding an in-app guided **Tour** — an
> interactive, in-context walkthrough that teaches a workflow (Character
> Creation, combat setup, …) on the live sheets rather than in prose.

SoHL tours are built on {@link sohl.apps.foundry.SohlTour}, a subclass of
Foundry's NUE `Tour`. A stock Foundry tour is a static JSON list of steps that can
only highlight elements already on screen and advance on **Next**. `SohlTour` adds
the three things every substantive SoHL tour needs:

1. **Scene-setting navigation** — open an Actor/Item sheet and switch to a named
   tab, awaiting each render, so a step can point at something on a not-yet-open
   tab.
2. **Gated steps** — keep **Next** disabled until the user has done something: a
   **value gate** waits for a control to hold a value; an **action/state gate**
   waits for a predicate over document/DOM state.
3. **Re-render survival** — when the watched sheet re-renders, the highlight
   re-anchors to the fresh element instead of pointing at a detached node.

**PRIME DIRECTIVE.** A tour **coaches and waits** — it highlights and instructs,
and only ever automates _scene-setting_ (opening a sheet, switching a tab). It
**never makes the user's meaningful choices for them**. Gated steps exist so the
tour can _wait for the human to act_, not act on their behalf. See
[Action Cards & the Consent Model](../concepts/action-cards.md).

## The three step kinds

Every step is one of {@link sohl.entity.tour.TOUR_STEP_KIND}:

| Kind         | Behaviour                                                           | Declare with                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `free`       | Advances on **Next** regardless of what the user did.               | No `gate` (the default).                        |
| `value-gate` | **Next** disabled until a target control holds the required value.  | `gate: TourGate.value(predicate)`               |
| `state-gate` | **Next** disabled until a predicate over document/DOM state passes. | `gate: TourGate.state(predicate)` + `readState` |

Use a **free** step where the value genuinely doesn't matter (the character's
name, an attribute value, description text). Use a **gate** only where the tour
must not move on until the user has actually done the thing the step teaches.

## The gate model (Foundry-free, unit-tested)

The _decision_ — "should Next be enabled?" — lives in the Foundry-free
{@link sohl.entity.tour} module and is unit-tested without a running Foundry
(`tests/domain/tour/`). A gate is a {@link sohl.entity.tour.TourGate}: a kind plus
a pure predicate `(ctx) => boolean`. `SohlTour` reads the live sheet to build the
`ctx`, then calls {@link sohl.entity.tour.isNextEnabled} — the class never decides
gating itself.

- **Value gate** — `ctx.value` is the current value of the step's watched control
  (its `control` selector, or the step `selector` if `control` is omitted).
  Ready-made predicates live in {@link sohl.entity.tour.gateValue}
  (`equals`, `oneOf`, `matches`, `nonEmpty`, `truthy`); compose your own for
  anything else.
- **State gate** — `ctx.state` is whatever your step's `readState(tour)` returns.
  Because that reader touches Foundry (documents, the open sheet), it lives on the
  step (`readState`), _outside_ the pure gate — keeping the predicate testable.

A gate **fails closed**: a predicate that throws (or returns a non-boolean) keeps
**Next** disabled, so a buggy gate never lets the user slip past.

## Navigation

A step navigates before it is shown by declaring either:

- `nav: { uuid, tab, group }` — open the document at `uuid`, switch to `data-tab`
  `tab` in group `group` (defaults to the sheet's primary group), awaiting each
  render; or
- `resolveDocument: (tour) => doc` — when the target isn't known ahead of time
  (e.g. "the actor the user is building"), resolve it dynamically. The tab still
  comes from `nav`.

`SohlTour` scopes a step's `selector` to the opened sheet, so the same selector
resolves correctly even with several sheets open, and it polls briefly for the
target to appear after a post-navigation render.

## Selector & timing guidance

- **Prefer stable selectors.** Target `[data-tab]`, `[data-action]`, and
  `name="…"` attributes over generated classes or nth-child positions.
- **Gate non-destructively where you can.** A value gate on a transient control
  (a search field) or an action gate on a navigation the user performs (clicking a
  tab) teaches without changing the character's data.
- **The framework waits; it doesn't click.** Don't try to satisfy a gate from the
  tour — the point of a gate is to wait for the human.
- **Re-renders are handled for you.** You don't need to re-declare a step after a
  sheet re-render; the highlight re-anchors automatically.

## A worked example

`src/apps/foundry/tours/framework-demo-tour.ts` is a small tour that exercises the
whole framework against a Being sheet — a free intro, sheet navigation, a value
gate (a search field), an action gate (the user switches to the Combat tab), and a
free wrap-up. Read it alongside this guide; it is the template a new tour is written
from. The e2e spec `cypress/e2e/guided-tours.cy.js` drives it end to end. It is
**registered but hidden** — `display: false` (see [Listing vs. hiding a
tour](#listing-vs-hiding-a-tour)) keeps it in `game.tours` for the e2e suite to
drive (`sohl.framework-demo`) while it stays out of players' _Tour Management_,
since it is a framework demo, not a content tour.

For a full-scale example, `src/apps/foundry/tours/character-creation-tour.ts` is
the flagship **Character Creation** tour: ~20 steps that walk the whole Being sheet
(Facade, Profile, Skills, Gear, Combat, Mysteries, containers), mixing free steps
with value/state gates. Its archetype gates are worth studying — each reads the
created instance's inherited `system.shortcode` (see the [archetype-first create
dialog](../../../src/document/item/foundry/SohlItem.ts)) to confirm the _right
archetype_ was chosen without forcing a name. It is driven end to end by
`cypress/e2e/character-creation-tour.cy.js`.

`src/apps/foundry/tours/assisted-combat-tour.ts` is a second content tour, the
**Assisted Combat** tour: single-actor and "pretend" throughout (no token, scene,
or encounter), it coaches one existing Being from a weapon on the sheet to an
attack, an impact, and a recorded injury. It is worth studying for its _non_-archetype
state gates — the bow held in two limbs (`structure.limbsHolding(bowId) >= 2`, the
exact transition that surfaces a two-handed weapon's strike mode) and a recorded
wound (an `injury`-subtype Trauma on the Being) — and for _not_ gating the roll
steps, matching how Assisted Combat leaves the opposed outcome to the players'
rulebook ruling. It is driven by `cypress/e2e/assisted-combat-tour.cy.js`.

### Listing vs. hiding a tour

`display` controls whether a **registered** tour appears in _Settings → Tour
Management_ — it does not control registration. A content tour meant for players
uses `display: true` so they can find and launch it. An **internal** tour — a
framework demo, or a fixture that exists only for the e2e suite to drive — should
be registered with `display: false`: it stays in `game.tours` (so a spec can
`game.tours.get("sohl.framework-demo").start()`), but never clutters a player's
Tour Management list. Registration and visibility are independent: hiding a tour
does not unregister it.

### Offering a tour on first run

A tour listed with `display: true` is always launchable from **Tour Management**.
To also _offer_ it — without ever auto-starting it (PRIME DIRECTIVE) — post a
non-blocking **whisper chat card** carrying a `[data-sohl-tour-start="<ns.id>"]`
button, once per user, guarded by a per-user `User` flag. `registerSystemTours`
does this for the Character Creation tour and binds the button through a
`renderChatMessageHTML` handler that calls `game.tours.get(id).start()`. Prefer a
whisper card over a modal dialog: it follows the offer-don't-act consent model and
never blocks (including the headless e2e client).

Its shape, condensed:

```ts
const config: SohlTourConfig = {
  namespace: "sohl",
  id: "my-tour",
  title: "SOHL.Tour.MyTour.title",
  display: true, // list in Tour Management (vs. false — see "Listing vs. hiding")
  // canStart omitted → always startable. Add it ONLY for hard eligibility the
  // user can't fix from within the tour; coach a satisfiable prerequisite in a
  // first step instead (see "Gate on eligibility, or coach the prerequisite?").
  steps: [
    // Free — centered intro.
    { id: "intro", title: "…", content: "…" },
    // Navigation + value gate — switch to Skills, wait for the search box.
    {
      id: "search",
      title: "…",
      content: "…",
      selector: 'input[name="search-skills"]',
      resolveDocument: () => firstOwnedBeing(),
      nav: { tab: "skills", group: "primary" },
      gate: TourGate.value(gateValue.nonEmpty()),
    },
    // Action gate — wait until the user opens the Combat tab themselves.
    {
      id: "combat",
      title: "…",
      content: "…",
      selector: '[data-action="tab"][data-tab="combat"]',
      resolveDocument: () => firstOwnedBeing(),
      gate: TourGate.state((ctx) => ctx.state === "combat"),
      readState: () => firstOwnedBeing()?.sheet?.tabGroups?.primary,
    },
  ],
};
return new SohlTour(config);
```

### Gate on eligibility, or coach the prerequisite?

`canStart` is a **hard eligibility gate**: when it returns `false`, Foundry greys
out the tour's **Start** button — with **no reason shown** to the user. That is the
right behavior only when the tour genuinely cannot run and the user cannot fix it
from within the tour (a feature is disabled, the wrong document type is open).

When the prerequisite is something the user _can_ satisfy — owning a populated
Being, having a particular item — **do not gate `canStart` on it.** A greyed-out
Start with no explanation is a dead end. Instead leave the tour **always startable**
and make its **first step a Next-disabled state gate that coaches the user to
satisfy the prerequisite**, so the later steps (which assume it) always have a
subject. The Assisted Combat tour does exactly this: it omits the `canStart` gate
and opens with a `prepare` step —

```ts
{
    id: "prepare",
    title: "SOHL.Tour.AssistedCombat.prepare.title",
    // Coaches: keep the Being you own, or import the Áldrik Hárvenar pregen
    // (Actors compendium → Pregens → right-click → Import Entry).
    content: "SOHL.Tour.AssistedCombat.prepare.content",
    gate: TourGate.state((ctx) => ctx.state === true),
    readState: () => Boolean(firstOwnedBeing()),
}
```

— whose **Next stays disabled until an owned Being exists**. The user is told what
to do and how, rather than meeting a Start button they cannot press. Rule of thumb:
_can the user act on it right now?_ If yes, coach it in a first step; if no, gate
`canStart`.

## Driven (railroaded) tours

Everything above is **coach-and-wait**: the tour highlights, waits, and only ever
automates scene-setting. A handful of tours — the **Automated Combat** tour above
all — are a different animal: they are opinionated and _railroaded_, so they must
**drive** the app down a fixed path and make dice **deterministic** so the scripted
rolls come out the same every run.

These are heavier, reusable capabilities kept deliberately separate from the
coach-and-wait core. Reach for them **only** for a tour whose
explicit job is to demonstrate an automated workflow end to end — never to nudge a
coaching tour past a choice the human should make. The PRIME DIRECTIVE still holds:
a driven tour is sanctioned because _demonstrating the automation_ is its whole
point, not because driving is ever the default.

### Drive steps

A step may **perform** actions before it is shown by declaring a `drive` array.
Each action is executed and fully awaited in order, so the next action — and the
step's own `selector` — sees the world state the prior one produced. Drive actions
run **before** the step's `nav`, so navigation can target a document a drive
created (e.g. an actor from an imported adventure).

The drive vocabulary is {@link sohl.entity.tour.TOUR_DRIVE_KIND}:

| Kind               | Does                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `import-adventure` | Import an Adventure document (by `uuid`) into the world.               |
| `activate-scene`   | Activate a Scene (by `uuid`) and await its canvas render.              |
| `start-combat`     | Start a Combat over `tokenUuids` (or all scene tokens); optional init. |
| `roll-initiative`  | Roll initiative for every combatant in the active combat.              |
| `advance-turn`     | Advance the active combat to the next turn.                            |
| `set-target`       | Set the current user's target to a token (by `tokenUuid`).             |
| `clear-target`     | Clear the current user's targeted tokens.                              |

```ts
{
    id: "engage",
    title: "…",
    content: "…",
    drive: [
        { kind: "activate-scene", uuid: "Scene.xxxx" },
        { kind: "start-combat", tokenUuids: ["Scene.xxxx.Token.aaaa", "Scene.xxxx.Token.bbbb"], rollInitiative: true },
        { kind: "set-target", tokenUuid: "Scene.xxxx.Token.bbbb" },
    ],
}
```

The **sequencing/await** logic ({@link sohl.entity.tour.runDrive}) is Foundry-free
and unit-tested (`tests/domain/tour/TourDrive.test.ts`); `SohlTour` supplies the
Foundry-coupled executor. A drive action that throws **halts the sequence** and
propagates — and the seeded-RNG teardown below still fires, because the error
unwinds through the tour's exit path.

### Seeded RNG — and its one hard teardown obligation

Set {@link sohl.apps.foundry.SohlTourConfig.seedRng} to run the tour in
**seeded-RNG mode**: {@link sohl.random} is seeded at tour start so its scripted
rolls are reproducible across runs.

```ts
const config: SohlTourConfig = {
  namespace: "sohl",
  id: "automated-combat",
  seedRng: "automated-combat-tour", // reproducible dice for the duration
  steps: [/* … drive steps … */],
};
```

> ⚠️ **The seeded RNG MUST be restored on every exit path, and this is the tour's
> only teardown obligation.** `sohl.random` is the process-wide shared stream; a
> seed left in place makes the **user's real game return identical dice until they
> reload**. The restore is registered at seed time as a fire-once
> {@link sohl.entity.tour.RngLease} (a `finally`-style hook) so it cannot be
> skipped, and `SohlTour` invokes it from **all** of: normal completion, user
> abort, the Escape keybinding, navigation away (a `pagehide` safety net), and a
> mid-step error. The lease's `restore()` is idempotent, so those redundant hooks
> are safe. If you extend the framework, never add an exit path that bypasses
> {@link sohl.apps.foundry.SohlTour}'s `exit`/`progress`/`pagehide` teardown.

Because `restore()` rewinds `sohl.random` to its **exact pre-tour stream
position** (not a fresh entropy seed), the game continues the stream it would have
produced had the tour never run — there is no observable perturbation once the tour
ends. The seed/restore mechanics are Foundry-free and unit-tested
(`tests/domain/tour/TourRng.test.ts`); the all-exit-paths guarantee is proven by
the exit-path matrix in `cypress/e2e/guided-tours-drive.cy.js`.

## Registering a tour

Register from the system `ready` hook in
[`registerSystemTours`](../../../src/apps/foundry/tours/register-tours.ts) so the tour
appears in **Tour Management** (`display: true`) and can be launched from there:

```ts
game.tours.register("sohl", "my-tour", buildMyTour());
```

Localization keys (`title` / `description` / each step's `title` / `content`) go in
`lang/en.json` under `SOHL.Tour.*`; `content` may contain HTML. Never rename an
existing key — add new ones.
