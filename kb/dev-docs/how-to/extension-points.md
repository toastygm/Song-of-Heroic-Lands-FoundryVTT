# Extension Points (Developer Guide)

> **Audience:** Developers maintaining or extending SoHL.
> **Goal:** Identify the safest places to add features with minimal risk.

See also: [Architecture Overview](../concepts/architecture.md), [House Rules Cookbook](./house-rules-cookbook.md), [Security Model](../concepts/security-model.md).

## Choosing extension scope

- Use a **Module hook** for additive behavior without modifying SoHL source — best for house rules that affect many items or actors.
- Use **actions** (context-menu entries on a document) for single-item behavior overrides (e.g., one specific spell). A Script Action can also **override an intrinsic action** on that one document by reusing its `shortcode` — see [Overriding an intrinsic action](../concepts/macros-and-actions.md).

Lifecycle hooks are emitted with item-type granularity (`sohl.<itemType>.<stage>`). Filter by `item.system.shortcode` inside the handler for narrower targeting.

### Recommended module guard pattern

When a hook performs persistent side effects, guard it with a world-setting toggle **and** a GM-only check, so the rule is opt-in per world and runs under a single authority. See the worked recipe in [House Rules Cookbook — guard pattern](./house-rules-cookbook.md#recipe-3-the-recommended-guard-pattern).

## Golden rule

**Extend by adding new classes and registering them**, rather than editing core logic in-place — see the [architectural rules](../concepts/architecture.md#architectural-rules) and [extension mechanisms](../concepts/architecture.md#extension-mechanisms).

When in doubt:

1. Find the nearest existing example.
2. Replicate the pattern.
3. Change the minimum.

## 1) System initialization & registration

Primary files: `src/sohl.ts`, `src/core/logic/SohlSystem.ts`

Common extension needs: register new settings, sheets, hooks, or document classes.

**Guidelines:** Keep registration logic explicit and centralized. Avoid side-effect imports.

Registration runs in `Hooks.once("init")` (settings, system config, calendars, hooks, combat/time defaults, sheet registration), then `Hooks.once("ready")` (Handlebars helpers, then `SohlSystem.ready = true`). Read `src/sohl.ts` for the authoritative order, and add new registration alongside the existing calls there and in {@link sohl.core.logic.SohlSystem}.

## 2) Actor and Item type extension

### Actors

Core actor classes: `src/document/actor/` with base `SohlActor` in `foundry/`.

The per-type split into Document, DataModel, Logic, and Sheet classes — and how they relate — is covered by the [three-layer architecture](../concepts/architecture.md#three-layer-architecture) and [three-class pattern](../concepts/architecture.md#three-class-pattern); read those rather than re-deriving them here.

**How to extend:** Add logic class in `src/document/actor/logic/`, data model + sheet in `src/document/actor/foundry/`, register in {@link sohl.core.logic.SohlSystem}.

### Items

Core item classes: `src/document/item/` with base `SohlItem` in `foundry/`.

Same layering as actors.

**Worked example (new Item kind):**

1. Add the kind constant + metadata in `src/utils/constants.ts` (`ITEM_KIND`, `*_METADATA`).
2. Create the logic class in `src/document/item/logic/` and the data model + sheet in `src/document/item/foundry/`.
3. Register the data model / logic / sheet in {@link sohl.core.logic.SohlSystem}.
4. Add templates and localization keys.
5. Verify `fromData(...)`, drag/drop, sheet rendering, and context-menu behavior resolve; validate startup.

This is the canonical "add a type" procedure — the [Runtime Contracts](../reference/runtime-contracts.md) safe-extension checklist points here.

**Avoid:** Adding `if type === X` branches in base classes; prefer polymorphism.

### Overriding a Logic class from a module (runtime)

The steps above add a kind in-system. A **variant module** instead overrides an
existing kind's Logic class at runtime — no source edits. The base classes are
exposed on the `sohl` global as `sohl.actorLogicClasses` / `sohl.itemLogicClasses`
(kind → base class), and {@link sohl.core.logic.SohlSystem.registerActorLogic} /
{@link sohl.core.logic.SohlSystem.registerItemLogic} swap the class used to build every document
of that kind. The resolution path (`SohlDataModel.create`) already reads that
registry, so no construction sites change.

Register during the module's `init`/`setup` hook, before the first `.logic` for
that kind is built:

```js
Hooks.once("setup", () => {
  class MyBeing extends sohl.actorLogicClasses.being {
    // override rules here
  }
  sohl.registerActorLogic("being", MyBeing);
});
```

Every being actor prepared afterward uses `MyBeing`. `registerItemLogic(kind,
cls)` is the item-side equivalent, keyed by `ITEM_KIND`.

## 3) Combat / tests / resolution pipeline

Core components:

- `src/entity/result/*` — test and combat result classes
- `src/entity/modifier/*` — value tracking and modification
- `src/document/combatant/` — combatant tracking
- `src/entity/action/SohlActionContext.ts` — request context

**Safe extension:**

- Add a graded / special-result test as **data** — see [the recipe below](#adding-a-graded--special-result-test--pass-data-dont-subclass) — not a new class.
- Add new `*Modifier` types for new influences.
- Keep results serializable for chat/UI.

**High-risk:**

- Changing shared modifier interpretation rules
- Changing success thresholds or resolution order

### Adding a graded / special-result test — pass data, don't subclass

The most common "new test" need is a d100-vs-mastery-level roll that reports a
**bespoke set of outcomes** and optionally **offers a follow-up action** — a
Stumble ("Keeps Footing" / "Stumbles"), a Fumble ("Retains Grip" / "Drops It"),
a Shock test, a Fear test. **None of these is a new class.** Do not subclass
`SuccessTestResult`, and do not write a bespoke result card. Drive the single,
well-tested generic path — {@link sohl.entity.modifier.MasteryLevelModifier.successTest} — and
supply everything bespoke as **data in the action scope**:

- **`scope.resultDescTable`** — a [result-description
  table](../reference/result-description-tables.md) (`LimitedDescription[]`) that
  maps each success rung to its label / description / star count. This _is_ the
  bespoke result text, carried as serializable data.
- **`scope.targetValueFunc`** _(optional)_ — remaps the value the outcome grades
  against when the test keys off something other than the raw constrained mastery
  level (e.g. the success-value tests use `index + successLevel - 1`).
- **`scope.priorTestResult`** _(optional)_ — reuse an already-rolled result instead
  of rolling fresh (Fate, GM edits, opposed resume). The die is **not** re-rolled;
  see the [prior-result seam](../reference/modifier-model.md).

Because you drove the generic path, the test inherits **impairment/fatigue
gating, Fate eligibility, `priorTestResult` reconstruction, and standard-card
rendering** with no extra code. A subclass re-implements all of that and drifts
from the one path everyone else fixes bugs in.

**Follow-up consent buttons ride the standard card.** When a graded result should
_offer_ an action (apply the shock state, record a healing rate), you no longer
need a bespoke `postActionCard` template. Post the standard card yourself and hand
it `buttons` — one {@link sohl.document.chat.ActionCardButton} or an array:

```ts
// Roll the generic test but don't auto-post (`noChat`), then post with a button.
const result = await mlMod.successTest(
  new SohlActionContext({
    speaker,
    scope: { resultDescTable: keepControlTable(winner), noChat: true },
  }),
);
if (result) {
  await result.toChat({
    buttons: {
      action: "applyStumble",
      handlerUuid: this.uuid,
      scope: { priorTestResult: result },
      label: sohl.i18n.localize("SOHL.Being.Stumble.apply"),
      iconFAClass: "fa-solid fa-person-falling",
    },
  });
}
```

`toChat` folds `buttons` through the same `toRenderableButtons` normalizer the
action-card framework uses (scope pre-serialized, `skipDialog` defaulted), so each
button carries the well-known `action-card-button` handles and dispatches through
the shared chat-card chokepoint. **Nothing auto-fires** — the button is _offered_,
and the target's controlling player accepts (the consent model). See the
[`toChat` card-data contract](../reference/result-description-tables.md#the-tochat-card-data-contract).

**When you _do_ subclass.** Reserve a `SuccessTestResult` subclass for a test whose
**roll math genuinely differs** — a different die, a multi-roll resolution, a
non-threshold outcome. New result _text_ or a new follow-up _button_ is never, by
itself, a reason to subclass. `AttackResult` / `OpposedTestResult` are the
existing examples of a legitimately different resolution.

See [Combat Resolution Pipeline](../reference/combat-resolution-pipeline.md) and [Modifier Model](../reference/modifier-model.md).

## 4) Active effects

Core: [SohlActiveEffect](../../../src/document/effect/foundry/SohlActiveEffect.ts).

SoHL extends Foundry's ActiveEffect with an expanded targeting model (`targetType` / `targetName`) so one effect can target self, the owning actor, or sibling items by type. See [Active Effects](../concepts/architecture.md#active-effects) for the model and [Effects Integration](../reference/effects-integration.md) for the full reference.

## 5) UI: templates and chat cards

- Chat cards: `templates/chat/*`
- Dialogs: `templates/dialog/*`
- Actor/item sheets: `templates/actor/*`, `templates/item/*`

**Safe extension:** Add new templates rather than overloading existing ones. Keep template context objects stable and well-documented.

### Adding a chat-card button

Chat-card buttons (inside `.card-buttons`) and `a.edit-action` links are routed by
the `renderChatMessageHTML` hook in `sohl.ts`, which resolves the handler document
from the clicked element's dataset and invokes its `onChatCardButton(btn)` (or
`onChatCardEditAction`). The dataset attribute precedence is a contract — see
[Chat-card dispatch contract](../reference/runtime-contracts.md#chat-card-dispatch-contract).

When adding a new button: **emit one of the recognized dataset attributes** (do not
introduce a new attribute name), and **add an `action` case** to the resolved
document's handler — e.g. `SohlItem.onChatCardButton` (see [SohlItem](../../../src/document/item/foundry/SohlItem.ts)), which switches on
`btn.dataset.action`.

To pass **data** to the action — a result, a request object — do not invent a new
`data-*-json` attribute; put the whole payload in one `data-scope`. The card-creation
logic sets a scope field (`scopeData: defaultToJSON(scope)`) and the template renders
`data-scope="{{toJSON scopeData}}"` (the `{{toJSON}}` helper stringifies it); the
handler revives it with {@link sohl.utils.buildActionScope}, so the `action` case reads **live
objects** off `context.scope` (e.g. `context.scope.attackResult`), never a JSON string.
See [Chat-card dispatch contract — Passing scope](../reference/runtime-contracts.md#passing-scope-to-a-button)
and the [Entity serialization contract](../reference/runtime-contracts.md#entity-serialization-contract).

### Cross-actor effects (the acknowledge-button pattern)

Enforce **[actor state sovereignty](../concepts/architecture.md#actor-state-sovereignty)**: an actor mutates only itself. To make one actor affect another, **never reach into the target** — instead:

1. **Resolve the source side on the source.** Roll the attack / spell / effect test against the source's own modifiers and mutate only the source.
2. **Emit a target-addressed button.** Post a chat card whose button carries the _target_ actor's uuid in `data-handler-actor-uuid` (or `data-handler-uuid`) and an `action`. The label must make the consequence unmistakable ("Acknowledge you fall asleep").
3. **Apply on the target's client.** In the target's `onChatCardButton` `action` case, run any required test first (e.g. a resistance roll), then mutate **this** actor.

Render-time gating makes the button appear only to the responding actor's owner (the GM owns all). `gateAutomatedDefenseButtons` (`src/document/chat/chat-card-gating.ts`) is the reference: it removes a button whose `data-handler-actor-uuid` actor the current user does not own (`actor.isOwner`). Reuse this gating for any new target-addressed button.

**Working examples already in the tree:** automated-combat defense buttons (resolve on the _defender's_ client) and the `createInjury` / "Calculate Injury" button (the _target_ wounds itself). Model new mechanics — spells, conditions, knockback, afflictions — on these; do not add a code path where the source writes the target's state.

## 6) Localization

- `lang/en.json`

**Rules:**

- Never rename keys (breaks translations and downstream consumers).
- Add new keys; deprecate old keys slowly if needed.

## 7) System registries

`src/core/logic/SohlSystem.ts` — the central registry for CONFIG mappings.

**Rules:**

- Keep mappings explicit.
- Avoid runtime reflection-based wiring.
- Validate registrations early during init.

## 8) Event triggers (time, combat, scene-region)

The event queue (`sohl.events`) dispatches named **triggers**, and a subscription
runs a document action when one fires — the deferred half of the consent model.
Extension surfaces:

- **Subscribe an action to a trigger** from a Logic class's `finalize()`
  (`sohl.events.subscribe({ uuid, actionName, triggerName, predicate })`) — the
  built-in `updateWorldTime` / combat-lifecycle triggers, plus the **scene-region**
  and **environment** triggers (`regionTokenEnter`/`Exit`/`Turn*`/`Round*`,
  `sceneDarknessChange`). Region triggers are event-driven: no
  `fireAt`, so `nextFireTime` is `undefined` and `system.lastRun` is the temporal
  query.
- **The `trigger` RegionBehavior** ({@link sohl.document.region.foundry}) is
  the GM opt-in surface: dropped on a region, it forwards curated events into the
  queue (GM-gated, once) and can offer a region-authored action. High-frequency
  streams (`tokenMove*`) are excluded by curation.
- **Register a custom trigger** ({@link sohl.entity.event.registerSohlTrigger} +
  {@link sohl.entity.event.fireSohlTrigger}) to add your own lifecycle moment.

All Foundry hook wiring lives in `SohlHookBridge` — do not call `Hooks.on(...)`
elsewhere for dispatch. See the [Event Queue Reference](../reference/event-queue.md).

## 9) Calendar registration

SoHL keeps a registry of calendars that modules can extend; registered calendars
appear in the GM's calendar settings. The registry API
(`SohlSystem.registerCalendar` / `unregisterCalendar` / `getCalendar` /
`applyCalendar` / `calendars`), how to register from a module, and the JSON import
format are documented in the
[Calendar Reference](../reference/calendar.md#calendar-registry-and-gm-workflow).

## 10) Create-dialog archetypes (`system.templatePriority`)

The shared Create dialog (`sohlCreateDialog`, used by both `SohlActor` and
`SohlItem`) offers an **Archetype** picker that seeds a new document from an
existing, fully-populated one — so a new Being is born with body, attributes, and
movement instead of blank. Archetypes are **data, not code**: no source change is
needed to add one.

**The contract.** Mark any Actor/Item — in a compendium pack or in the world —
with `system.templatePriority = <priority:number>` and it becomes an archetype for its
`(type, subType)` in the picker. The value is a numeric priority (see below);
`null` — the field's initial value — means "not an archetype", and a non-numeric
value is ignored.

**`system.archetype` is read as a compatibility fallback.** A module written
against that name keeps working: a world document is migrated on construction,
and discovery reads a compendium **index** under either spelling — an index
entry is raw stored data that never passes through a data model, so a pack
emitting only the old name would otherwise contribute nothing, silently. Emit
`system.templatePriority` in new packs. `archetype` belongs to the
character-**sort** taxonomy that authored content spells `archetypes`; a
priority and a taxonomy separated only by a plural `s` is a trap.

**`0` is a priority, not a blank.** SoHL's own archetypes ship at priority `0`,
so the tri-state has two states that both look empty and are **not**
interchangeable: a **number** is an archetype at that priority, `null` is not an
archetype. `0` is falsy, so every reader tests `typeof v === "number"` and never
truthiness — see {@link sohl.entity.archetype.readTemplatePriority}, which is
the one place that decision is made.

**Setting it needs no JSON editing.** The marker is a schema field, so each
sheet header carries a GM-only **Archetype Priority** control bound to
`system.templatePriority`; a blank box is `null`. (On the Being sheet, whose header
renders identity as text, it lives in the header's identity dialog alongside
Name and Shortcode.) Foundry ships no flag editor, so a flag would mean
exporting the document, hand-editing the JSON and re-importing.

**Identity is the shortcode, not the name.** After the `(type, subType)` filter,
an archetype's `system.shortcode` is its identity. Two candidates sharing a
shortcode are the _same_ logical archetype even if their names differ (a
localization, or a diverged world copy) and are deduped to one winner; the name
is presentation only. Keep a shortcode stable and meaningful — same spirit as the
stable-`lang`-key rule.

**Winner selection (only matters on a shortcode collision).** Among candidates
sharing a shortcode, the winner is chosen by _priority descending, then source
tier ascending (**world 0 < system 1 < module 2**), then a stable UUID_. So a
GM's **world** copy shadows a shipped **system** archetype at equal priority
(no priority fiddling needed), and a **module** must ship `priority > 0` to
override a system archetype (a module left at `0` loses by tier — it cannot
silently clobber a stock archetype). New archetypes with fresh shortcodes always
appear regardless of priority. SoHL ships its stock archetypes at **priority 0**.

**The Foundry-free discovery/resolution helper.** The rules above live in the
Foundry-free {@link sohl.entity.archetype} module and are unit-tested
independently of any dialog: {@link sohl.entity.archetype.resolveArchetypes}
filters by `(type, subType)`, dedups by shortcode, and returns winners sorted
best-first; {@link sohl.entity.archetype.buildArchetypeOptions} turns those into
UUID-valued `<option>`s (labelled `Name (shortcode)`) plus **(none)**, defaulting
to the top winner (or **(none)** when the type has no archetype). The Foundry
boundary that gathers candidates from the world directory and every matching
compendium pack is `fvttDiscoverArchetypes` in `FoundryHelpers.ts`.

**Archetype-first defaulting (Name/Shortcode).** The dialog is laid out
**Type → SubType → Archetype → Name → Shortcode**, with Name and Shortcode
**optional**. Selecting an archetype pre-fills Name and Shortcode from its own
`name` / `system.shortcode` (live, until you type into a field); leaving them
blank creates a document that matches the archetype — its shortcode _is_ the
archetype's, subject only to uniqueness bumping (`broadsword`, `broadsword2`, …).
Choosing **(none)** keeps the blank-slate behavior: Name defaults to the class
`defaultName` and the Shortcode derives from the Name. The resolution rules are
the Foundry-free, unit-tested {@link sohl.entity.archetype.resolveCreateIdentity}
(the dialog only wires the DOM and applies
{@link sohl.utils.uniqueShortcode} against the taken set).

**Shortcode uniqueness (create + update).** `(type, shortcode)` is a unique lookup
key, enforced at runtime across world / embedded / pack scopes — see
[Shortcode Integrity](../reference/shortcode-integrity.md). The Create dialog
**live-checks** the entered shortcode against that scope and disables **Create**
until it is unique (the `_preCreate` reject is the backstop). A programmatic caller
opts into automatic key management with the **`shortcodeDedupe: true`** create/update
option — a colliding code is suffixed and a name-less create gets a random id, so it
never fails; without it, a collision is rejected. System-generated item creation
(`fvttCreateEmbeddedItems`, cross-actor gear drops) opts in; the human dialog stays
strict so the author picks a unique code deliberately.

**Instantiation clears the marker; copy-verbatim preserves it.**
`system.templatePriority` is reset to `null` at every point where an archetype is
_instantiated_ into a live document, and kept only when a document is copied _as
a library entry_. The single primitive is the pure
{@link sohl.entity.archetype.clearArchetypeMarker}. It **writes `null`** rather
than deleting a key — `0` is a real marker, so "clear it" can never be spelled
as "drop a falsy value".

- **Clear — Create dialog** seeding from an archetype: a document created from an
  archetype is not itself an archetype.
- **Clear — Drop-to-embed:** dragging a compendium **or world** item onto an
  actor/item sheet creates an **embedded**, in-play child — never a template. The
  clear lives in `SohlActorSheetBase._onDropItem`, immediately before
  `createEmbeddedDocuments("Item", …)`, so the marker never rides onto the owner
  (an embedded item that kept it would pollute discovery and could be
  re-instantiated as if it were a template).
- **Preserve — Import and Duplicate** of a top-level directory document: these are
  copy-verbatim operations that yield another _library_ document; preserving the
  marker is exactly how a GM makes a world-tier override.

> **Never move the clear into `_preCreate`.** That hook runs for _every_ create —
> dialog, drop-embed, directory Import, and Duplicate alike — so it cannot
> distinguish instantiation from copy-verbatim. If it ever migrates there, the
> world-override workflow silently breaks (Import/Duplicate would lose the
> marker). It must stay at the specific instantiation entry points (dialog +
> drop), and both sides are guarded by tests.

for the module-author recipe.

## What to update when you add something

- **New actor/item type:** Add class, register, add templates, update JSDoc, update docs.
- **New user-facing workflow:** Add or update the user guide under `assets/packs/journals/_source/` (compiled into Foundry journal entries at build).
