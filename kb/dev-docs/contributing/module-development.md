# Writing Modules for SoHL

_How to build a Foundry VTT **module** that integrates with or extends Song of
Heroic Lands (SoHL) without modifying the system itself._

A module is the right vehicle for complex house rules, added content and
automation, alternate rulesets, and re-skins — anything you want to ship and
toggle independently of the core system.

The guiding principle is the same one the system holds itself to: **extend, don't
fork.** SoHL exposes hooks, registries, a public runtime object, and CSS variables
precisely so a module can layer on top. Editing system source is not an
integration strategy — when the system updates, your changes are lost and your
users' worlds are at risk.

## How a module attaches to SoHL

SoHL is a Foundry **system** with id `sohl` (see `system.json`), requiring Foundry
**v14+**. A module targeting it declares that relationship in its own
`module.json`, so Foundry knows the module is meant to run under SoHL:

```json
{
  "id": "my-sohl-module",
  "title": "My SoHL Module",
  "compatibility": {
    "minimum": "14"
  },
  "relationships": {
    "systems": [
      {
        "id": "sohl",
        "type": "system",
        "manifest": "https://github.com/HeroicLands/Song-of-Heroic-Lands-FoundryVTT/releases/latest/download/system.json",
        "compatibility": {
          "minimum": "0.7.0"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "esmodules": ["scripts/my-module.js"]
}
```

(See Foundry's [Module Development](https://foundryvtt.com/article/module-development/)
article for the full manifest schema.) Your module's `esmodules` entry script
then hooks into the system at runtime — a minimal skeleton:

```js
// scripts/my-module.js
Hooks.once("init", () => {
  console.log("my-module | init");
  // Register settings, keybindings, etc. here.
});

Hooks.once("ready", () => {
  // `sohl` and every document's `.logic` are available from here on.
  // Extend behavior with SoHL lifecycle hooks (see below) — never edit core.
  Hooks.on("sohl.mysticalability.postFinalize", (item, ctx) => {
    // your house rule
  });
});
```

## Reaching the SoHL API

A module reaches SoHL through the same two surfaces any script uses — the global
`sohl` object (system-wide services and helpers) and each document's `.logic`
(per-document state and actions). See **[The SoHL API](../concepts/sohl-api.md)**
for both surfaces and the `SohlSystem` member reference. For **type-safe** module
development, install the generated types package
(`npm install -D @heroiclands/sohl-types`) and reference it in your `tsconfig.json`
(`"types": ["@heroiclands/sohl-types"]`) — it types the `sohl` global and exports
the public class/interface types for annotations (see
[API Access Map](../how-to/api-access-map.md#type-declarations-for-a-typescript-module)).

> The reachable public API is still being formalized (epic
> [#80](https://github.com/HeroicLands/Song-of-Heroic-Lands-FoundryVTT/issues/80)).
> Treat the canonical how-to references below as the source of truth for exact
> registration calls, and prefer hooks for behavior you want to be stable.

## Extension mechanisms

SoHL supports all of the standard hooks provided by Foundry VTT.
In addition to these hooks, SoHL also supports a number of other hooks that
can be used to integrate with the system.

### Lifecycle hooks — cross document behavior

When a document is processed by SoHL, it goes through various lifecycle methods.
Hooks have been developed to allow you to add your own processing at these
critical points. This allows you to add or alter the behavior of skills, gear,
or other items uniformly across all documents. See [Lifecycle Hooks](../how-to/lifecycle-hooks.md)
for the full hook reference, the arguments each receives, and the recommended
**module guard pattern** (a world setting toggle plus a GM guard) so your module
is opt-in and side-effect-safe.

### Registries — calendars

The system keeps registries a module can add to during `init`, including the
**calendar** registry. The exact registration calls live in
[Extension Points](../how-to/extension-points.md) (§7 System registries,
§8 Calendar registration) — follow that document so your code matches the
maintained API.

### New types, sheets, effects, and chat cards

Adding a new actor/item type or sheet follows the system's layering pattern
(Document → DataModel → Logic → Sheet). [Extension Points](../how-to/extension-points.md)
walks through registering new types, active-effect integration, and UI/chat-card
templates. Read [Architecture Overview](../concepts/architecture.md) first for the
three-layer model and the Foundry-free logic boundary your additions must respect.

### Scheduling deferred actions

A module can schedule an **action** to come due at a future world time — a
recurring "check for bandits" roll, a wound's next healing test, a seasonal
upkeep prompt. This is the generic scheduler (issue #588). It never _performs_
the action on its own: when the schedule comes due, SoHL posts a `[Perform]`
reminder card addressed to the document's owner, and only their click runs it.
That is the [Prime Directive](https://www.heroiclands.org/sohl/kb/dev-docs/) in mechanism form —
_reminding is allowed; performing is not._

**1. Put the action on a document.** The thing you schedule is an ordinary SoHL
action — an `actionDefs` entry on the host document's `system`, typically a
Script Action referencing a permission-gated Macro (see
[Macros and Actions](../concepts/macros-and-actions.md); never inline code into
data). Attach it programmatically with `sohl.addScriptAction` rather than
hand-writing the `actionDefs` array:

```js
// bind a permission-gated Macro as a runnable SCRIPT action (GM only)
await sohl.addScriptAction(host, {
  name: "checkForBandits", // becomes the action shortcode AND default title
  executor: macro.uuid, // a Foundry Macro UUID — a reference, never code
});
```

`sohl.addScriptAction(doc, spec)` fills the same defaults as the sheet's "create
action" control, so you supply only `{ name, executor }` (plus optional `title` /
`scope` / `iconFAClass` / `group` / `minActorOwnership` / `trigger` / `visible`).
The `name` you pass is the identity `sohl.schedule` and the `[Perform]` reminder
key on, so keep it stable; re-attaching the same `name` **replaces** the entry, so
an init hook is safe to run on every reload. Authoring a SCRIPT action is GM-only
(it is a no-op for a non-GM), matching the security rule.

The host must be a document that carries `system.scheduledActions`, which means
one whose data model extends the base `SohlDataModel`: an **actor** or an
**item**. Scenes and active effects extend `TypeDataModel` directly and _cannot_
host a schedule.

**2. Schedule it** with `sohl.schedule`, from any owner of the document:

```js
// interval is in seconds of world time; payload is opaque scope handed to the
// action when the owner clicks [Perform].
await sohl.schedule(item, "healingTest", 24 * 60 * 60, { severity: 3 });
```

`sohl.schedule(doc, actionName, interval, payload?)` does two things atomically:
persists the schedule to `doc.system.scheduledActions` (the durable record,
anchored at the current world time) **and** arms the live event queue. Both halves
derive the fire time from the same anchor + interval, so they cannot drift. To
make a schedule **recurring**, call `sohl.schedule` again from inside the action
after it performs — each occurrence schedules the next. `sohl.unschedule(doc,
actionName)` removes both halves.

> **Consent (issue #579): offer, don't auto-re-arm.** A recurring action must not
> silently reschedule itself — that would make the system act without a human. When
> due, the queue posts an owner-gated `[Perform]` reminder (it never runs the
> action); on the click the action performs, then **offers** the next occurrence
> and only schedules it on a yes. The core effects use the shared
> `offerSchedule(context, doc, actionName, interval)` helper (a `context.scope.schedule`
> answer, else a private default-No dialog); a module action can call `sohl.schedule`
> conditionally on its own confirmation. Reserve unconditional re-arming for
> genuinely ambient, GM-only world-host clocks (e.g. a bandit check).

**3. World-wide actions** have no natural document to hang off. Use the singleton
**world host** actor:

```js
const host = await sohl.worldHost(); // find-or-create the `sohlworld` actor
if (host) await sohl.schedule(host, "checkForBandits", 6 * 60 * 60);
```

`sohl.worldHost()` returns the reserved `sohlworld` actor, creating it (GM only,
ownership NONE so players never see it) if absent. Because it is an actor it
already has the execution surface a `[Perform]` needs. Pass `{ visibility: "gm" }`
in the payload to whisper the reminder to the GM only — no metagame leak for
world events.

**4. Scene-scoped actions** — most events belong to a **place** (bandits at a
hideout, a hazard on a caravan path), not the whole world. Pass a `sceneUuid` and
the schedule fires only while that scene is the **active** scene:

```js
await sohl.schedule(host, "checkForBandits", 4 * 60 * 60, { visibility: "gm" }, scene.uuid);
```

`sohl.schedule(doc, actionName, interval, payload?, sceneUuid?)` — with a
`sceneUuid`, a check that comes due while the party is elsewhere is **held, not
lost**: it surfaces the moment they return to (re-activate) that scene, and no
occurrences accrue while away. Omit `sceneUuid` (as in the examples above) for a
genuinely world-wide clock — a plague, a season — that fires regardless of the
active scene. A schedule on an unlinked token's actor is naturally scene-scoped:
name its token's scene.

**The reload path is automatic.** The event queue is rebuilt from scratch each
session, so on the `ready` hook SoHL re-arms every world actor and its embedded
items from their persisted `system.scheduledActions` (scene binding included). You
schedule once; it survives reloads without any further wiring on your part.

### Triggering on a scene region (issue #593)

Beyond time, an action can fire on **where** a character is. SoHL bridges Foundry
v14 scene-region events into the same queue, so the consent path is identical — a
region event surfaces an owner-gated `[Perform]` reminder, never a fait accompli.

There are two ways to author it, and neither modifies system source:

1. **From the GM's chair, no code.** Drop a **"SoHL Event Trigger"** RegionBehavior
   onto a region, tick the events to forward (`Region: Token Enters`, …), and name
   an **action to offer** (a shortcode on the entering actor). Entering the region
   offers that action to the token's controlling player.

2. **From a module, per character.** Subscribe an action to a region trigger and
   scope it with a predicate — the region events are `regionTokenEnter` /
   `regionTokenExit` / `regionTokenTurn{Start,End}` / `regionTokenRound{Start,End}`,
   plus `sceneDarknessChange` for environment:

   ```js
   sohl.events.subscribe({
     uuid: actor.uuid,
     actionName: "fearCheck",
     triggerName: "regionTokenEnter",
     predicate: new sohl.entity.expr.SafeExpression({
       source: "regionId == 'crypt'",
     }),
   });
   ```

   The action receives the region context (`regionId`, `tokenUuid`, `actorUuid`,
   `sceneUuid`) as its scope. These triggers are **event-driven**: `nextFireTime`
   is `undefined`; use `actor.system.lastRun[actionName]` for "when last?". The GM
   must still place a "SoHL Event Trigger" behavior on the region for the events to
   flow — that is the human-behest opt-in. High-frequency streams (`tokenMove*`)
   are deliberately not exposed. See
   [Event Queue → Scene-region triggers](../reference/event-queue.md#8-a-scene-region-trigger--offer-a-check-on-entering).

### Shipping Create-dialog archetypes

The SoHL **Create Actor / Create Item** dialog offers an **Archetype** picker
that seeds a new document from a fully-populated template. Archetypes are pure
data — a module contributes them without any code.

**Specify a new archetype.** Ship an Actor or Item in your module's compendium
pack with two things:

- `system.templatePriority` set to a **number** (its priority), and
- a stable, meaningful `system.shortcode`.

`system.templatePriority` defaults to `null`, which means "not an archetype". Note that
`0` is a real priority, not a blank — SoHL's own archetypes ship at it — so
never test the value for truthiness.

The field was named `system.archetype` before issue #1836, and a pack that still
emits that name keeps being discovered — but emit the new one, because the old
spelling is read only as a compatibility fallback.

It then appears automatically in the Create picker for its `type` (and `subType`),
alongside the shipped archetypes. A brand-new archetype with a **fresh shortcode**
needs no particular priority value — it shows up regardless of priority.

**Override an existing archetype (prioritization).** To replace a shipped (or
another module's) archetype rather than add a new one, ship a document with the
**same `shortcode`** as the target and a **higher `system.templatePriority`**
than the one you are overriding:

- SoHL ships its stock archetypes at **priority 0**, so **any positive number**
  overrides a stock archetype.
- To override _another module's_ archetype, exceed **its** priority.
- **Source-tier rule.** At _equal_ priority the source tier decides — **world >
  system > module** (a lower tier wins). So a GM's own **world** copy of an
  archetype always outranks any module, and a module left at priority `0` loses
  to the system archetype it collides with (it cannot silently clobber it).
- Equal priority _and_ tier (module vs. module) resolves by a stable but
  arbitrary UUID tiebreak — pick **distinct** priorities if the outcome matters.

**Shortcode is stable identity.** The shortcode is the override/dedup key: never
localize or casually rename it (same spirit as the stable `lang/en.json` keys).
The display **name** is free to vary or be localized — the picker labels options
`Name (shortcode)` precisely because dedup can collapse divergent names.

A GM can set the same field from the sheet: every Actor and Item sheet header
carries a GM-only **Archetype Priority** control bound to `system.templatePriority`
(on the Being sheet it is in the header's identity dialog).

See [Extension Points → Create-dialog archetypes](../how-to/extension-points.md#10-create-dialog-archetypes-systemtemplatepriority)
for the full contract, the Foundry-free discovery helper, and the
instantiation-clears / copy-preserves boundary.

### Credits & attributions

Every SoHL package — the system and each module — surfaces its credits the same
way: a **Credits** button at the top of its own tab in Game Settings, which opens
a JournalEntry the package ships in its own compendium. This exists so third-party
attribution reaches the people running the game, rather than sitting in a file on
disk that nobody opens. If your module bundles artwork, fonts, or audio under a
license that requires attribution (Game-Icons' CC BY 3.0, most Noun Project
icons), this is how you satisfy it in the medium.

There are three steps, and the system provides the hard part.

1. **Ship a credits JournalEntry** in your module's own compendium. It is an
   ordinary journal — nothing about it is special to SoHL.
2. **Declare its UUID** in your `module.json`, under the shared flag key:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "my-module",
     "flags": {
       "sohl": {
         "creditsUuid": "Compendium.my-module.journals.JournalEntry.abcdef0123456789"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Register the menu during `init`**, passing your module id:

   ```js
   Hooks.once("init", () => {
     sohl.apps.foundry.registerCreditsMenu("my-module");
   });
   ```

   Every display string may be overridden with your own `lang` keys:

   ```js
   sohl.apps.foundry.registerCreditsMenu("my-module", {
     name: "MYMODULE.Credits.name",
     label: "MYMODULE.Credits.label",
     hint: "MYMODULE.Credits.hint",
     icon: "fa-solid fa-heart",
   });
   ```

**Register it first.** Foundry renders a package's settings menus in
`game.settings.menus` insertion order, ahead of its plain settings — so call
`registerCreditsMenu` **before** your module's other `registerMenu` calls, or the
button will not be at the top of your tab.

**It is not GM-only.** The menu registers with `restricted: false` by default,
because credits exist to be read. Pass `restricted: true` only if you have a
specific reason to hide them from players.

If the manifest flag is missing, registration no-ops with a console warning
rather than adding a button that silently does nothing — so a forgotten flag
fails visibly.

Why a factory rather than a class you subclass: Foundry constructs a settings
menu's `type` with **no arguments** and then calls `render(true)` on it, so your
UUID cannot be passed in at construction. `registerCreditsMenu` builds a menu app
that closes over the UUID and opens the journal instead of rendering a window of
its own. {@link sohl.apps.foundry.makeCreditsMenuApp} and
{@link sohl.apps.foundry.openCreditsJournal} are exported if you need the pieces
separately.

### Re-skins and theming

A module can restyle the system purely through CSS by overriding the `--sohl-*`
custom properties — no markup changes. See
[CSS Architecture & Styleguide](../concepts/css-architecture.md).

## Boundaries

- **Don't modify system source** to achieve integration — use the seams above.
- **Respect backwards compatibility and the data model.** A module must not rename
  or reshape system data fields; if it stores its own data, namespace it under your
  module id (e.g. via flags).
- **Keep the logic boundary in mind.** The system's game rules live in a
  Foundry-free logic layer; mirror that separation in your own module where it
  helps testability.

For the standards your contributions to the core system must meet (as opposed to a
standalone module), see [System Development](./system-development.md).
