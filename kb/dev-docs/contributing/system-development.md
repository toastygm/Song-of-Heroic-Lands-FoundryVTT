# System Development

How to make a change to the Song of Heroic Lands (SoHL) **system codebase** that
fits its architecture and gets merged. Stability, architectural coherence, and
long-term maintainability are critical — many people run long campaigns on this
system, so this guide is deliberately strict about process. Read it before your
first contribution.

> Want to **build a module**, or write **macros / Script Actions**, rather than
> change the system itself? Start from the repository's
> [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md), which points each audience to the right
> guide. This page is for working on the system codebase.

## Governance

- The project is maintained by the repository owner. Architectural decisions remain
  under maintainer authority.
- All changes are submitted via Pull Request — no direct commits to protected
  branches.
- Contributions are welcome, but maintainers reserve the right to decline changes
  that do not align with the long-term direction of the system.

## License agreement

By submitting a contribution (code, documentation, or creative content), you certify
that:

- You have the legal right to contribute the material.
- You agree that your contribution is licensed under the project's dual-license
  structure:

specific creative expression used to describe them (rulebook text, proprietary
terminology, etc.) may not be reproduced. If you are unsure whether material is
permissible, ask before contributing it. Contributions found to contain prohibited
content will be removed immediately.

## Getting set up

- **Prerequisites:** **Node.js** (see `engines` in
  [`package.json`](../../../package.json) for supported versions) and **Git**. All
  other tooling (TypeScript, Vite, Sass, Prettier, ESLint, vitest) installs via
  `npm ci` and runs from `node_modules`. Optional, for specific workflows: SSH
  access to a remote host (deploying to a remote Foundry instance via
  `npm run push:dev` / `push:prod`, which use SFTP over SSH — no `rsync` needed) and
  `gh auth login` (so the legacy local release helper, `utils/release.mjs`, can read
  a GitHub token from your keychain).
- **First steps:** fork the repo, branch from `main`, run `npm ci`, and copy
  `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` (gitignored; one per developer). See
  [Getting Started](../how-to/getting-started.md) for the full setup and codebase
  tour.
- **Learn the mental model before changing anything:**
  [Architecture Overview](../concepts/architecture.md) — the three-layer design and
  a map of the `src/` tree.

## Core rules (non-negotiable)

1. **No cosmetic refactors.** This is a large, interdependent system; cosmetic
   churn causes regressions. Change code because behavior needs it.
2. **Extension over rewrites.** Prefer hooks, actions, registries, and subclassing
   over editing core source.
3. **Small, focused changes.** One feature, one bug fix, or one documentation
   improvement per PR. No mixed refactors or "drive-by cleanups."
4. **No placeholders or stubs.** Submit complete, working implementations.
5. **Backwards compatibility.** Never rename, remove, or restructure existing data
   fields without a migration strategy (see below) — treat every data-model change
   as high-risk.
6. **Stable localization keys.** Never rename existing keys in `lang/en.json`; add
   new keys instead. Name every new key by the standard in
   [Localization Keys](../reference/localization-keys.md) — it is the rule the
   "never rename" rule freezes in place.
7. **The logic layer stays Foundry-free.** All Foundry API access goes through
   `src/core/FoundryHelpers.ts` (see [Architectural boundaries](#architectural-boundaries)).
8. **Test-driven development.** Write the test before the code it verifies.
9. **Never compile data into code.** No `eval`, `new Function`, or
   `Handlebars.compile` of data-derived strings; never revive functions from
   serialized data. Data carries only _references_ (a `__kind` tag, an intrinsic
   method name, or a Foundry Macro UUID). Never build HTML by interpolating data into
   template source, and remember that client-side gating is not authorization.
   Read [Security Model & Guardrails](../concepts/security-model.md) before
   touching serialization, HTML rendering, actions, or cross-client flows.

## Development workflow

### Definition of Done

A fix **in this repository** is done when **all** of these hold. Work tracked here
but delivered in another package repository or on heroiclands.org cannot meet the
repository-specific gates — see [Work delivered in another
repository](#work-delivered-in-another-repository) below.

- [ ] A tracking issue exists (except `chore`), reproduced or with
      confirmed acceptance criteria, and the **root cause is recorded in a comment**.
- [ ] Work is on a correctly named branch (`<type>/<issue_#>_<slug>`) off current
      `main`.
- [ ] **Tests were written first**, cover the fix (unit by default; e2e or a pure
      helper + unit where Foundry wiring is involved), and any pre-staged RED spec
      for this behavior is un-skipped.
- [ ] `npm run test` is green — the new tests **and** the full suite.
- [ ] The implementation obeys the non-negotiable rules: Foundry-free logic +
      shims, backwards-compatible data (migration if needed), stable lang keys, no
      compiling/HTML-from data, complete (no stubs), and scoped to the one issue.
- [ ] Conventions met: file headers, complete JSDoc, null/undefined discipline,
      and no `TODO`/`FIXME` markers (deferred work lives in issues).
- [ ] Documentation updated for the changed behavior (JSDoc, dev docs, user guide),
      and `type-catalog.md` committed if the schema changed.
- [ ] A `.changeset/` entry exists for `feat`/`bug` work, correctly bumped,
      issue-referenced, and format-clean.
- [ ] Only your files are formatted (`npm run format:check` clean).
- [ ] **`npm run build` and `npm run docs` both pass** without errors.
- [ ] Committed in Conventional-Commits style and a PR is open with `Closes #<n>`
      and a what/why description.

### Work delivered in another repository

The project spans several repositories, and **each one tracks the work it delivers**
— see [Issue Reporting §9](../how-to/issue-reporting.md#9-which-repository-does-an-issue-belong-in)
for how to choose. `sohl-thalorna` and `sohl-kethira-basic` carry their own copy of
the four-axis standard; `heroiclands-site` is still tracked from here, under the
`site` label.

Several gates above simply do not exist outside this repository. A `site` issue is
delivered in `heroiclands-site`, where there is no `.changeset/`, no `npm run build`,
no `npm run docs`, and no `npm run format:check`. Do not invent equivalents, and do
not treat their absence as work left undone.

What still holds for any tracked work, wherever it lands:

- [ ] A tracking issue **in the repository that will deliver it**.
- [ ] A correctly named branch in that repository.
- [ ] Verification appropriate to that repository — a site build that succeeds, a
      pack build that compiles, a page that renders.
- [ ] Documentation updated for the changed behaviour.
- [ ] A commit or PR description saying what changed and why.
- [ ] If the work also closes an issue **here**, that issue is closed **by hand**,
      with a comment linking the delivering commit or PR. `Closes #<n>` does not work
      across repositories: GitHub records the reference and leaves the issue open.

### Issue first

No repository change lands without a tracking GitHub issue — **except** pure
`chore/*` work (housekeeping and tooling with no shipped-behavior change). File
or find the issue before you start so you have its number for the branch name.

**Documentation is not a `chore`.** User-visible documentation is a `bug` (what
is published is wrong, broken, or misleading) or a `feature` (new or expanded
coverage) — a tracking issue and a changeset, like any other change. This
includes **JSDoc** (it publishes to the API site) and other user-facing docs (the
`docs/` pages and the user guide). Only non-published housekeeping — internal
(non-JSDoc) code comments, build and tooling config, and repo meta — is
`chore/*`.

When you open an issue, the **body is the problem statement only** — symptoms,
reproduction, expected vs. actual, and optionally acceptance criteria. Root cause
and the proposed fix go in a **comment**, not the body.

### Branch naming

- Feature and bug branches: `<type>/<issue_#>_<short-kebab-summary>` — for example
  `bug/59_actor-pack-embedded-keys` or `feat/72_combat-tracker-actions`.
  The `<issue_#>` segment is the parseable source of truth; the trailing slug is a
  human-readable label.
- Issue-free types: `chore/<slug>`.

**Committing on `main` is refused locally.** `main` is protected on GitHub, so a
commit made on it could never be pushed — but that only becomes apparent at push
time, once the commit exists and has to be moved off the branch. Two hooks in
`.githooks/` (`pre-commit` and `pre-merge-commit`, sharing
`protected-branch.sh`) move the refusal forward to the commit, where the fix is
still just "branch first" — and `git switch -c <branch>` keeps whatever you have
staged. There are two hooks because git runs `pre-merge-commit` _instead of_
`pre-commit` for a merge, so guarding only the latter would still let a stray
`git pull` on `main` write a merge commit.

Like the `commit-msg` hook below, they are activated for you when `npm install`
runs its `prepare` script. They are an accident guard, not a control:
`git commit --no-verify` bypasses them, and `git config hooks.allowCommitOnMain
true` opts a checkout out permanently. A rebase replays commits with HEAD
detached and is deliberately unaffected.

### Test-driven development

Write the test first, watch it fail, then implement. Tests run in Node via
[vitest](https://vitest.dev) — **no Foundry VTT required**:

- Construct logic objects with the builders in `tests/mocks/logicHarness.ts`
  (`makeItemLogic` / `makeActorLogic` / `makeMockActor` / `makeAttributeStub`).
- Use `it.todo("...")` to document intended-but-unimplemented behavior.
- Run `npm run test` before `npm run build`. See [Testing](../how-to/testing.md).

### No TODOs in code

Deferred work is tracked in **GitHub issues, not flagged in the code**. Do not
commit `TODO`/`FIXME` markers: a code marker duplicates the issue and drifts out
of sync, and a marker inside published JSDoc leaks into the API site as
documentation prose. When you would write a `TODO`, file (or find) an issue,
record any code-site context in that issue, and leave the code clean.

Every pull request is checked by
[`HeroicLands/.github/actions/todos`](https://github.com/HeroicLands/.github),
which fails on **any** `TODO`/`FIXME` marker in a comment under `src/`. The rule
is not this repository's — every HeroicLands repository wants it, differing
only in paths and extensions — so the check lives where every one of them can
reach it rather than in each repository's own build. String contents are
blanked before matching, so a literal `"TODO"` is not a finding.

### Update the documentation

**A PR that changes behavior updates the docs that describe it** — this is part of
done, not a follow-up:

- **JSDoc** for any public API whose contract changed.
- **Developer docs** under `docs/` — concept docs (`docs/concepts/`), how-to guides
  (`docs/how-to/`), or reference (`docs/reference/`) — when the mechanic or
  architecture a reader relies on has moved. Add a worked example where it clarifies
  a pattern.
- **User guide journals** (`assets/packs/journals/_source/`) when a player-facing
  workflow changed.
- **Extension points** — [Extension Points](../how-to/extension-points.md) when you added or
  changed one.

Documentation-link conventions in `docs/`: link to code **by symbol** (`{@link Symbol}`)
for API-documented symbols, path-only file links for DataModels/Sheets, and **never**
line-range fragments (they rot on any edit).

`docs/reference/type-catalog.md` is **generated and committed**. When your schema
change makes it show as modified, commit it — never hand-edit or revert it.

The bound-variables table in `docs/concepts/expressions.md` is likewise generated
— from the expression-scope catalog (`src/entity/expr/expression-scopes.mjs`) —
into a marked region of an otherwise hand-written page. Adding or changing an
expression call site means running `npm run docs:expr-scopes` and committing the
result; `npm run lint` fails on a stale copy. Edit the catalog, never the
generated region.

### Changesets

`feat/*` and `bug/*` branches **always** add a `.changeset/` entry — regardless of
whether the change is user-facing. `chore/*` need none.
Keep the changeset current as work progresses (don't write it only at the end),
reference the issue, and describe **only the fix** — the problem context lives in
the issue. See [Writing Changesets](./writing-changesets.md) for details.

### Format before commit

Run `npm run format:check` (Prettier, through `content-build format`) **first**.
If a file you did **not** touch shows up as unformatted, stop and ask — do not
run `format` blind, since it formats the whole repo and would sweep unrelated
drift into your commit. Once only your files are flagged, run `npm run format`,
then `git add` only your files. Both commands take paths, so
`npm run format -- <path>` formats exactly what you name.

That should be rare: the same check runs as `lint:format`, first in
the `lint` chain, so `main` cannot carry drift for long. Two things still produce
it, and they call for opposite responses. A **Prettier version bump** invalidates
the tree wholesale — a minor that changes a layout rule reformats files nobody
edited; that belongs in its own reformat-only commit, not in yours. Since the
formatter and its configuration now arrive with `@heroiclands/package-build`,
such a bump reaches this repository as a **content-build** bump, and shows up
the same way: files you did not touch, flagged by `lint:format`. A **single stray file** is ordinary drift and is yours to
format if you were touching it anyway. Either way the rule above holds: format by
explicit path, never the whole repo.

### Commit messages

Do **not** add AI/assistant attribution to commit messages, pull-request
titles/bodies, or issues — no `Co-Authored-By:` trailer naming an assistant, and
no "Generated with Claude Code"-style signature. A committed `commit-msg` hook
(in `.githooks/`, activated for you when `npm install` runs its `prepare` script,
which sets `core.hooksPath`) rejects such commits locally, and the **No
Attribution** GitHub Actions check fails any pull request whose title, body, or
commit messages carry it. Neither guard edits anything — they only report and
fail, so you decide how to fix it.

### Submitting a pull request

Before opening the PR, both of these must pass without errors:

```bash
npm run build
npm run docs
```

Submit with a clear description of what changed and why.

## Architectural boundaries

The **logic/domain layer is Foundry-free**, and new logic/domain code must keep it
that way: never value-import from `**/foundry/**` or other Foundry-coupled modules —
use `import type`, or add a `fvtt*` shim to `src/core/FoundryHelpers.ts` (plus its
mock). The boundary, why it holds, and the ESLint + purity guards that enforce it are
described in [Architecture → Logic layer](../concepts/architecture.md#logic-layer) —
read it (and [Extension Points](../how-to/extension-points.md)) before changing core
systems.

## Do not touch without maintainer approval

Open an issue and discuss before changing any of the following — do not submit
unsolicited PRs for them:

- The foundations: `SohlSystem.ts` (registration/wiring), `SohlDataModel.ts`,
  `SohlItem.ts` / `SohlActor.ts`, `SohlLogic.ts`, world migration logic, and
  `sohl.ts` (system initialization).
- Core data-model changes, the combat-resolution pipeline, the class registry, and
  large or cross-cutting refactors.

If a data-model change is unavoidable it must be approved first, documented, ship
with automatic migration code that upgrades old worlds seamlessly, and be tested
against real world data — migrations must never require manual user intervention.

## Conventions

- **File headers.** Every `.ts` file carries the GPL-3.0 license header; every
  `.hbs` file carries the HBS license header.
- **Namespace barrels.** Every `src/` folder that is a namespace — it holds an
  exporting module, or a subfolder that does — carries a hand-written `index.ts`
  that re-exports its sibling modules (`export * from "./X"`) and its subfolder
  namespaces (`export * as sub from "./sub"`), with a `/** … */` description on
  each `export * as` line (it becomes that namespace's API-doc prose). These
  barrels form the `sohl.*` tree, so the reference path equals the file location
  (`sohl.document.effect.foundry.SohlActiveEffect`). Adding a module or folder
  means updating its barrel; `npm run lint:ns-barrels` (part of `npm run lint`)
  enforces completeness and descriptions. Side-effect-only modules (no top-level
  `export`) are not namespace members and are excluded.
- **JSDoc.** Public-API JSDoc feeds TypeDoc generation — keep it complete and
  lint-clean. PRs that modify behavior update the relevant docs: JSDoc for public
  APIs, [Extension Points](../how-to/extension-points.md) for extension points, and
  the user guide under `../../assets/packs/journals/_source/` for user workflows.
- **Documentation links.** In `docs/` markdown, link to code by **symbol**, not
  coordinates. Use `{@link Symbol}` / `{@link Symbol.member}` for API-documented
  symbols — it resolves to the symbol page on the API site and never drifts.
  For symbols absent from the API (DataModels, Sheets), use a path-only file link
  (no line numbers) and name the symbol in prose. **Never** use line-range fragments
  (`#L120-L140`): they rot silently on any edit and duplicate TypeDoc's automatic,
  commit-pinned source links.
- **JSDoc → doc-page links.** The reverse direction — a **JSDoc comment pointing
  at a concept/reference doc** — links to the doc's **knowledgebase URL**
  (`https://www.heroiclands.org/sohl/kb/dev-docs/<path>/`, e.g.
  `https://www.heroiclands.org/sohl/kb/dev-docs/concepts/security-model/`). The
  API site is strictly generated symbols; the prose lives on the KB, so a
  relative `.md` link from JSDoc has no page to resolve to. `{@link}` targets
  code symbols only, not doc pages. Non-rendered `//` or `/* */` comments (which
  TypeDoc does not emit) may instead cite the repo path `kb/dev-docs/…​.md`,
  which a source reader opens directly.
- **Stylesheets and markdown are linted, not just formatted.** Prettier owns the
  whitespace of both; `npm run lint:styles` (stylelint) and `npm run lint:markdown`
  (markdownlint) — both part of `npm run lint` — own what it cannot see. In SCSS
  that is the BEM class convention and the `--sohl-*` token namespace, which
  [CSS Architecture](../concepts/css-architecture.md) publishes as an extension
  surface; in markdown it is document structure and links that do not link. Both
  rule sets are deliberately narrow and both configuration files carry the
  rationale per rule — see
  [Build & Deployment → What the two linters check](../how-to/build-and-deployment.md#what-the-two-linters-check)
  before adding to either. A deliberate exception is annotated at the site with a
  `stylelint-disable` comment and its reason, not by switching the rule off.
- **Localization keys.** Every user-visible string is a key in `lang/en.json`, named
  by the standard in [Localization Keys](../reference/localization-keys.md):
  `SOHL.<Namespace>[.<Group>].<leaf>`, where the namespace is a singular PascalCase
  **concept** (`SOHL.Action`, not `SOHL.SohlAction`), group segments are PascalCase
  (ALL-CAPS is reserved for Foundry's own `FIELDS`), leaves are camelCase or an enum's
  stored value, and placeholders are single-braced `{camelCase}`. No method names and
  no data — paths, UUIDs, names — in a key segment. Since keys are permanent, get the
  name right the first time.
- **Foundry v14.** Target Foundry VTT v14+ and follow the v14 patterns described in
  the [Architecture Overview](../concepts/architecture.md).
- **Null vs. undefined — null at the edges, undefined in the core.** Absence is not
  spelled two ways at random:
  - _Persistence and the Foundry API boundary use `null`._ DataModel fields and
    the Foundry APIs that natively return `null` (`DialogV2` dismissal, `getFlag`,
    document lookups) keep it — Foundry mandates it and `null` survives
    `JSON.stringify` where `undefined` keys are dropped.
  - _The logic/domain layer uses `undefined`_ for "maybe absent" — matching
    optional parameters/properties (`?:`), which already yield `undefined`. Write
    `T | undefined` directly; there is no `Optional<T>` alias (an alias cannot
    cover `?:` positions, so it could never be the single consistent spelling).
  - _The `FoundryHelpers` shim normalizes_ Foundry `null` to `undefined` as values
    cross into the logic layer.
  - `== null` / `!= null` (matches both) is the blessed idiom at genuine mixed
    boundaries; `eqeqeq` (configured with `{ null: "ignore" }`) enforces strict
    equality everywhere else.
- **DataModel empty values — sentinel vs. nullable.** In persisted schemas the choice
  is semantic, not serialization-driven (both `null` and `""`/`0` round-trip). Use a
  typed blank sentinel (`""`, `0`, `[]`, `{}`) when the empty state is itself a valid
  value; use `nullable: true, initial: null` only when "unset / not-applicable" must be
  distinguishable from _every_ valid value (an optional cap, a die size, an optional
  reference). Always set `initial` explicitly — a bare `new StringField()` is
  non-required and silently initializes to `undefined`, not `""`.
  - _Optional "not specified" StringField → `null`, not `""`._ For an optional string
    that means "unset" when empty (an optional reference/code/UUID, a formula, a
    free-text field where blank and unset coincide), prefer
    `{ nullable: true, blank: false, initial: null }` over an `""` sentinel: `blank:
false` makes Foundry clean a cleared form input (and any legacy `""`) to `null`, so
    "unset" is one honest value rather than two. Declare the field — and its
    logic-`Data` interface — as `T | null`, and guard reads (`if (x)` / `x ?? ""`).
    Canonical examples: `SkillDataModel.ts` `parentSkillCode`, `TraumaDataModel.ts`
    `category`.
- **A `required` field carries no default.** `required: true` **and** an `initial` are
  contradictory: Foundry auto-fills a `required` field from its `initial` when the value
  is absent, so a defaulted field is never actually caller-mandatory. Where a field has
  a sensible default, make it optional-with-`initial` (**drop `required`**); reserve
  bare `required: true` (no `initial`) for a field a caller genuinely must supply — a
  TypedSchema discriminator, a mandatory key. Do **not** resolve the contradiction by
  dropping the `initial` instead: document creation fills absent fields from `initial`,
  so a `required` field with no default breaks bare creates.

## Extending SoHL instead of changing it

If you want to _extend_ the system rather than change its core — ship house rules,
add content or automation, or script behavior — do it from the outside:

- [Writing Modules](./module-development.md) — build a Foundry module that integrates with or
  extends SoHL via hooks, registries, the `sohl` public object, and CSS variables.
- [Macros and Actions](../concepts/macros-and-actions.md) — write macro-bar scripts or
  document-attached Script Actions against the SoHL API.
- [The SoHL API](../concepts/sohl-api.md) — the document and `sohl` surfaces scripts
  and modules use.

These build on the deeper how-to references —
[Extension Points](../how-to/extension-points.md) and
[Lifecycle Hooks](../how-to/lifecycle-hooks.md).
