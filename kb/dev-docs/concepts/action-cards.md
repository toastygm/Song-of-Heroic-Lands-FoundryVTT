# Action Cards & the Consent Model

How one player offers an action to another over the chat log — without ever
acting for them. This is the mechanism that makes the
[Prime Directive](./architecture.md) — _assist, never play the game_ — structural
rather than a matter of discipline. **Every automated interaction in SoHL is built
on the pattern this page describes**, so read it before you add any cross-client
flow (combat, treatment, timed retests, opposed tests).

See also: [Macros and Actions](./macros-and-actions.md),
[Security Model & Guardrails](./security-model.md),
[Combat Model](./combat-model.md).

## The one rule everything else follows

> **Automation happens only at a human's behest, never independently.** The system
> may _remind_ a player that something has come due; it may not _perform_ the
> action until that player specifically authorizes it. One player can never impose
> an action on another player's character.

An **action** (a {@link sohl.entity.action.SohlAction}) is the single unit of
"do something" in SoHL — it is what a context-menu entry, an Actions-tab button, a
macro, and a chat-card button all ultimately invoke. An **action card** is how an
action gets _offered_ to whoever should decide: a chat card whose button, when the
right player clicks it, runs that action on _their_ character. Nothing runs until
the click; the click is the consent.

## Self-sufficient actions

The keystone contract — **every action must be able to run on its own, from any
trigger.** Because a card button and a context-menu entry invoke the _same_
executor, that executor cannot assume it was handed its parameters. It resolves
them itself:

1. **Enough parameters already?** (a card pre-filled `context.scope`) — run.
2. **Interactive and missing parameters?** — open a dialog, gather them, then run.
3. **`skipDialog` and still missing parameters?** — use sensible defaults, or, as
   a last resort, abort with a notice (return `undefined`; never guess at a
   character's action).

```ts
// The SAME action, two triggers — it decides how to get its parameters.
async treatInjury(context: SohlActionContext) {
    let hr = context.scope?.healingRate;              // 1. card pre-filled it
    if (hr == null && !context.skipDialog) {          // 2. run by hand → ask
        const form = await dialog({ /* Healing Rate */ });
        if (!form) return undefined;                  //    cancelled → abort
        hr = Number(form.healingRate);
    }
    if (hr == null) return undefined;                 // 3. skipDialog + nothing → abort
    await this.item.update({ "system.healingRateBase": hr, /* … */ });
}
```

This is why an action card is **never special or privileged**. It is not a new
code path — it is the ordinary action, with its parameters supplied and its dialog
skipped. Anything a card can do, a player can do by hand, and vice versa.

## Building a card: `buildActionCard` / `postActionCard`

The card **body** and its **buttons** are independent concerns. You author the
body — any template or inline content, the same way any other chat card is
written — and never write the buttons yourself.
{@link sohl.document.chat.buildActionCard} renders your body and **appends the
standard button block**, returning the finished HTML;
{@link sohl.document.chat.postActionCard} is the one-line convenience that posts it
through a {@link sohl.core.logic.SohlSpeaker} (whose `toChat` accepts raw HTML).

```ts
await postActionCard(this.speaker, {
  template: "systems/sohl/templates/chat/treatment-request-card.hbs",
  data: { patientName, woundName, aspect, severity },
  buttons: {
    action: "performTreatmentTest", // the executor to run on click
    handlerUuid: SELF_HANDLER, // who may click it (here: open)
    scope: { injuryUuid }, // the action's pre-filled parameters
    label: "Perform Treatment Test",
    iconFAClass: "fa-solid fa-staff-snake",
  },
});
```

`buttons` may be:

- **one** button object,
- **an array** — e.g. an automated attack card's four defenses (Block /
  Counterstrike / Dodge / Ignore), each a different `action`, all targeting the
  defender, or
- **omitted** — an _informational_ card (a result with no next action to offer;
  e.g. a GM-directed treatment test with no target wound).

Each button becomes a `<button class="action-card-button">` carrying
`data-action`, `data-handler-uuid`, a pre-serialized `data-scope`, and
`data-skip-dialog="true"`. Data reaches the DOM only through Handlebars escaping —
**never** build a button's HTML by interpolating data into template source (see
[Security Model](./security-model.md)).

## The dispatch chokepoint

Every card-button and edit-link click funnels through one function,
{@link sohl.document.chat.dispatchChatCardAction}. It reads `data-action`, builds a
{@link sohl.entity.action.SohlActionContext} (reviving `data-scope`, and setting
`skipDialog` when the button carries `data-skip-dialog`), and dispatches to the
handler logic — by action name, executor id, or title, then a method fallback.
Because the card sets `skipDialog`, the pre-filled parameters flow straight through
and the action does not re-prompt.

The click is **authorized before anything runs**: the current client may act only
if it owns the handler document (a GM owns all). This is
{@link sohl.document.chat.resolveAuthorizedChatCardHandler} — the real boundary
. It runs before any dialog, scope revival, or logic; the render-time
hiding below is UX only and is bypassable.

## Open vs. targeted buttons — `@self`

A button's `handlerUuid` decides _who_ may answer it:

- **Targeted** — a document uuid. Only that document's owner may click it; it is
  **hidden from everyone else** at render time, so nobody clicks a button that does
  nothing for them.
- **Open** — the {@link sohl.document.chat.SELF_HANDLER} sentinel (`"@self"`).
  **Anyone** may answer; at click time it resolves to the clicking user's own
  `game.user.character`, and the action **self-gates** (e.g. aborts with a notice
  if that character lacks the Physician skill). Shown to everyone.

Use targeted when you know exactly whose decision it is (the defender responding to
an attack); use open when anyone qualified may step in (any physician answering a
call for treatment). The render-time rule is
{@link sohl.document.chat.gateActionCardButtons}; it is cosmetic — the click-time
authorization above is the actual gate.

## State lives in the chat log

There is **no server-side interaction store, no card is ever consumed or locked,
and completion is never enforced.** The posted cards _are_ the state. This is a
deliberate consequence of the consent model, and it buys three things:

- **Stop anytime.** Any card can simply be ignored. Up until the terminal action
  is clicked, nothing has mutated a character.
- **Branch and override.** A player can click Block, dislike the result, ignore it,
  and click Dodge instead — because every card is still live. A GM can step in and
  resolve anything by hand.
- **No stuck flows.** There is no state machine to get wedged; there is only a log
  of offers, any of which may still be answered.

An action that self-gates and aborts (returns `undefined`) simply leaves its card
live for someone else — nothing advances, nothing is spent.

## Worked example: the treatment flow

Three self-sufficient actions, connected by two cards. No orchestrator sits above
them — each action posts the next card itself, and each is independently runnable
from a sheet or context menu.

| Step       | Action (where)                                        | By hand                                                                                  | From the card                                                                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Request | `TraumaLogic.requestTreatment` (wound context menu)   | patient invokes it                                                                       | — (it is the entry point)                                                            |
| 2. Perform | `BeingLogic.performTreatmentTest` (Being Actions tab) | physician runs it; dialog takes a pasted injury UUID _or_ a GM-described severity/aspect | open `@self` button → runs on the clicker's own character, `skipDialog` + wound uuid |
| 3. Treat   | `TraumaLogic.treatInjury` (wound context menu)        | anyone runs it; dialog takes the Healing Rate                                            | owner-gated Accept button → `skipDialog` + the physician's proposed rate             |

1. The patient runs **Request Treatment** on the wound; it posts an _open_ Perform
   card.
2. Any physician clicks **Perform Treatment Test**; it runs on _their_ character,
   rolls _their_ Physician skill, and posts a **Treatment Result** card. If it had
   a target wound, that card bears an owner-gated **Accept** button carrying the
   proposed Healing Rate; a GM-directed test with no target posts an informational
   result with no button.
3. The patient clicks **Accept**; `treatInjury` records the rate on _their_ wound.

The physician never touches the patient's wound — the patient's own click does.
And because it is all just self-sufficient actions and live cards, the GM can
short-circuit any of it: run `treatInjury` by hand with a number and skip the
cards entirely.

## The `*Check` / `*Test` mechanic

Recurring conditions — a wound mending, an affliction running its course, a
character catching something they were exposed to — are all built from the same
pair of actions, and the split between them is the consent model applied to time.

> **A `*Check` offers; a `*Test` acts.**
>
> A `*Check` may be initiated by anyone and changes nothing: it posts a card
> offering the associated `*Test`. A `*Test` rolls, applies its outcome, and then
> offers to schedule the next `*Test` — anchored to the **last test's date**,
> never to the current moment.

Concretely:

|                      | `*Check` (`courseCheck`, `contagionCheck`, …) | `*Test` (`courseTest`, `contagionTest`, …) |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **What it does**     | Posts a card offering the test                | Rolls, applies the outcome                 |
| **Who may run it**   | **Anyone** — it imposes nothing               | Someone who controls the subject           |
| **Writes anything?** | No                                            | Yes                                        |
| **Visibility**       | Hidden — reached from the reminder or a card  | In the Actions context menu                |
| **Ends by**          | Waiting for a human to press the button       | Offering the next `*Test`                  |

### One check, one test

A `*Check` offers exactly one `*Test`, and performing it runs exactly one test —
however much world time has elapsed. There is no catch-up loop, no backlog pass,
and no "how many did we miss" arithmetic. Whether another check ever happens is
decided solely by the human answering the offer at the end of the test.

This matters for more than tidiness. When a single trigger rolled every missed
interval in one pass, the rolls mutated the state each later roll read — so one
click could cascade into an infection or a shock state nobody agreed to.

### Catch-up needs no machinery

Deleting the loop loses nothing, because the next test is anchored to the **last
test's date** rather than to now. A player who is behind therefore schedules a
next test whose fire time is already in the past: it is immediately due, its
`*Check` card posts at once, and the backlog drains itself — one card, one
consent, one test at a time, with the original cadence preserved exactly.

On a 5-day cadence anchored at day 0, with the player at day 22:

| Test performed | Next anchored at | Next due | Effect                        |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| day 5          | day 5            | day 10   | past → card posts immediately |
| day 10         | day 10           | day 15   | past → card posts immediately |
| day 15         | day 15           | day 20   | past → card posts immediately |
| day 20         | day 20           | day 25   | future → waits                |

Four tests, four separate consents, and the cadence still lands on day 25 — not
on day 27, where anchoring at the moment of each click would have pushed it.

This is not a hole in the queue's no-cascade rule: every step posts a **card** and
stops dead until a human presses it, so the chain advances only as fast as someone
consents to it.

### Naming

The names are load-bearing, so keep them mechanical: `<X>Check` offers `<X>Test`.
Where a check's name and the test it performs disagree, fix the name — a check
called one thing that rolls another is how the split stops being legible.

## Authoring a new flow

1. **Write each step as a self-sufficient action** on the document that owns the
   work — scope-or-dialog for its parameters, abort if it can't proceed. Register
   it in that logic's `defineIntrinsicActions` so a human can also run it directly.
2. **Post a card from the step that hands off**, with `postActionCard` — a body
   template plus a button whose `action` is the next step, `handlerUuid` is who
   should answer (a uuid, or `SELF_HANDLER` for open), and `scope` is that action's
   parameters.
3. **That's it.** The dispatch chokepoint, `skipDialog`, ownership authorization,
   and targeted-vs-open gating are already wired — you do not touch them.
