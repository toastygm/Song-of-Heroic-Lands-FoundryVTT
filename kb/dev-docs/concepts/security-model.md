# Security Model & Guardrails

This document is the security mental model for the SoHL system and the standing
guardrails every change must respect. It is written for both human and AI
developers: if you are adding a feature, reviewing a PR, or letting an agent
touch this codebase, read this first.

It is derived from a full security review of the system (see the epics linked in
[Tracking](#tracking)). The findings themselves live in the issue tracker; this
document distills the _durable rules and decisions_ so we do not reintroduce the
same classes of bug.

## Threat model

SoHL is a **FoundryVTT game system**. The code runs in players' and GMs'
browsers. The attacker-controlled inputs that matter are:

1. **Installed content** — world save files, modules, and shared compendium
   packs. Their item/actor/effect fields, action definitions, expression
   strings, domain-registry entries, and imported JSON are authored by whoever
   produced the package, and are then rendered or executed on the client of
   **every user who installs the content**, including the GM.
2. **Chat messages and their flags** — these propagate to every connected client
   and are re-rendered on each. Any client, including a non-GM player, can craft
   message content and `data-*` attribute values.

The high-consequence outcomes we defend against:

- **Arbitrary code execution** in a victim's browser (full Foundry API access
  with their session and world) via a compiled string or unsafe deserialization.
- **Stored/DOM XSS** via HTML built from data and rendered into sheets, dialogs,
  or chat.
- **Client-side denial of service** via catastrophic-backtracking regexes.
- **Cross-actor state corruption** via a client acting on documents it does not
  own.

The load-bearing consequence: **untrusted _data_ is the primary attack surface,
not untrusted _code_.** A malicious module author already runs code; our job is
to ensure that _data_ — a chat flag, an effect field, a serialized payload —
can never _become_ code or script on someone else's machine.

## The guardrails at a glance

Six standing rules follow, in priority order. **The first — _reference code,
never compile it from data_ — is the keystone**: it was the top finding of the
security review, and holding it is what makes the rest tractable. Each rule links
to its full statement below and to where the contract is specified/enforced.

## The core principle: reference code, never compile it from data

**Never turn data into executable code.** No `eval`, no `new Function`, no
`Function`/`AsyncFunction` constructor, no `Handlebars.compile` of
data-derived source — anywhere a value could have originated from installed
content or a cross-client message.

Data may only ever carry a **reference** to code that already exists:

| Reference  | For                                                | Encoding     | Resolves to                                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Class kind | Domain objects round-tripped through JSON          | `__kind` tag | A constructor looked up in `src/utils/kindRegistry.ts` |
| Method     | A shipped behavior on a Logic class (intrinsic)    | method name  | A bound method on the scoped target logic              |
| Macro      | GM-authored "homebrew" behavior created after ship | Macro UUID   | A Foundry `Macro`, run via `Macro#execute()`           |

Functions themselves are **never serialized** — not as source, and not as a
reference. A domain object carries **data plus its `__kind`**, and any behavior
is re-derived locally on the receiving client from that kind and data.

An attacker can put any value in a reference slot, but the worst they can do is
_select_ something the system already ships — they can never _introduce_ new
code. This makes the dangerous state unrepresentable rather than merely screened.

**Where this is enforced.** The JSON round-trip that drops functions on the way
out and revives no code on the way in is the
[Entity serialization contract](../reference/runtime-contracts.md#entity-serialization-contract);
the action executor model — an intrinsic **method name** or a **Macro UUID**,
never a code body — is {@link sohl.entity.action.SohlAction} and
[Macros and Actions](./macros-and-actions.md); the class registry is
`src/utils/kindRegistry.ts`; and the only string→value path permitted on
untrusted data is the AST-allowlist {@link sohl.entity.expr.SafeExpression}. There is deliberately
**no** function-id/`__funcref__` registry: nothing that needs to survive a
round-trip is a function, so none is serialized at all.

### Why not a sandbox / denylist?

Screening author-supplied script with a regex denylist before compiling it with
`new Function` is the obvious approach, and it does not hold. **A denylist over
source text is not a security boundary.** It is defeated at least four
independent ways, each verified by execution:

- **Unicode identifier escapes** — `fetch` is the identifier `fetch`; the
  literal substring never appears in the source, so a `\bfetch\b` scan misses it.
- **Function-constructor by string concatenation** —
  `(()=>{})['con'+'structor']('return this')()` reaches `globalThis`; the word
  `constructor` never appears as one literal.
- **Template-literal interpolation** — a comment/string stripper deletes
  `` `${...}` `` before scanning, but it still executes at runtime.
- **Comment interposition** — `x./**/constructor` slips past a `\.\s*constructor`
  pattern.

These are not patchable one at a time. The only sound options are an **AST
allowlist** (parse, then permit a fixed set of nodes/identifiers — this is what
{@link sohl.entity.expr.SafeExpression} does for predicates and why it is safe) or **not
compiling at all** (the reference model above). For behavior driven by
_untrusted_ data — installed content and cross-client messages — SoHL chose not
compiling at all: `SafeExpression` (`src/entity/expr/SafeExpression.ts`) is the
only string→logic path on that surface, and it is an allowlist, not a denylist.

**The one sanctioned exception: the GM Expression Library.** `textToFunction`
(the denylist screen) ships, used by the expression-helper registry
(`src/entity/expr/ExpressionHelperRegistry.ts`) to compile helper bodies loaded
from a **GM-chosen JSON file** (the Expression Library settings menu). This is a
_different trust tier_: the GM deliberately selects a local file, exactly as
they would install a module — it is not installed-package or cross-client data,
and the screen is documented as "a sandbox, not a hard security boundary." So it
is acceptable there and only there. Do **not** route any untrusted or
cross-client input through `textToFunction`, and do not add new callers of it —
if you need author-supplied logic on the untrusted surface, use `SafeExpression`
(sync values) or a Macro (async behavior).

### Why not digital signatures?

Signing serialized code was considered and rejected. A **symmetric MAC cannot
work** in a client-only Foundry system: there is no server-side secret, so any
client that can verify a signature can also forge one — and the attacker is one
of those clients. **Asymmetric signing** would only help a hypothetical "signed
content pack" feature, and even then verifies _provenance_, not _safety_. Foundry
macros give us provenance for free and at _write_ time (see below), with no key
to distribute or leak. Prefer the reference model; reach for signatures only if a
future feature genuinely must move novel code across the trust boundary, and then
only with asymmetric keys plus an AST allowlist.

### GM "homebrew": use Foundry macros, not a bespoke sandbox

Post-ship, GM-authored behavior runs through **Foundry `Macro` documents**,
referenced by UUID and executed with `Macro#execute()`. This inherits Foundry's
own, audited permission model:

- Creating or importing a _script_ macro is blocked unless the user holds the
  `MACRO_SCRIPT` permission (`common/documents/macro.mjs`). A malicious
  compendium cannot land auto-running script on a player who lacks it.
- `Macro#execute()` re-checks `canUserExecute` (ownership **and**
  `MACRO_SCRIPT`) before running, and passes `{ speaker, actor, token, ...scope }`.

Rules for using macros:

- **Only ever execute via `Macro#execute()`**, never by reading a macro's
  `command` into your own compiler.
- **Only invoke on the client that owns the acting document** — keep the
  target-addressed acknowledge model (a defense runs because the _defender's_
  user clicked, on the defender's client). A player-authored chat flag must never
  cause a macro to run on the GM's client without the GM's action.
- Understand the trade-off: a macro runs with full page authority. This is
  **authorization, not isolation** — the same trust decision as installing a
  module, but gated and explicit rather than silent. True isolation of shared
  homebrew (Realm/iframe/worker with a brokered API) is a separate, much larger
  effort and is out of scope.

> target logic. That is already safe (no compilation, the name is system-authored,

> does not need to become a macro.

### Extension points: which tool for which need

The safe extension mechanism depends on two axes — who authors it (shipped in
code vs. GM post-ship) and how it runs (a synchronous value vs. asynchronous
imperative behavior):

|                                  | **Shipped (in code)** | **GM-authored (post-ship)**                               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Synchronous, returns a value** | a method / intrinsic  | a {@link sohl.entity.expr.SafeExpression} (AST allowlist) |
| **Asynchronous, imperative**     | a method / intrinsic  | a Foundry **Macro** (`Macro#execute`)                     |

Two consequences to internalize:

- **A GM who needs a synchronous computed value uses a `SafeExpression`, not a
  macro.** `SafeExpression` parses to an AST, allowlists nodes, and evaluates
  synchronously and safely. Macros are asynchronous (`Macro#execute` returns a
  `Promise`), so they cannot return a value to a synchronous caller.
- **Synchronous _imperative_ GM code is intentionally unsupported.** You cannot
  let an untrusted author supply synchronous side-effecting code without
  compiling it — which is exactly the RCE this model removes. If you hit this,
  express the value as a `SafeExpression`, or restructure so the work runs
  asynchronously (a macro) and the synchronous path reads a cached result.

## Guardrail: safe serialization

`defaultToJSON` / `defaultFromJSON` in `src/utils/helpers.ts` are the JSON
round-trip for domain objects. Their security contract:

- **`defaultFromJSON` never revives executable code.** There is no
  `new Function` path and no function-reference path. (The historical
  `__func__:`/`deserializeFn` path that compiled a string into a function has
  been removed — do not reintroduce it.)
- **`defaultToJSON` never emits a function.** Functions are dropped to
  `undefined` — no source, and no reference. Behavior is not serialized.
- **Reconstruction of `__kind`-tagged objects** goes through the kind registry
  and should validate/allowlist the tag and the shape — a client can craft the
  JSON, so treat revived data as untrusted input to the constructor.
- **`buildActionScope`** reads chat-card `data-scope` (fully attacker-controlled)
  and rejects any legacy `__func__:` marker outright as defense-in-depth.

A serialized object carries **data plus its `__kind`**. If the receiving client
needs a behavior, it re-derives it locally from the kind and data (e.g. a small
strategy enum resolved to a shipped function on that side) — never by carrying a
function across the wire, and never by `JSON.parse` + evaluate.

## Guardrail: HTML rendering / XSS

Author-controlled strings (item/actor/effect names and descriptions, domain and
calendar names, modifier breakdowns) reach dialogs, sheets, and chat cards.

- **Never interpolate data into Handlebars _template source_.** Building a
  template string with `` `...${item.name}...` `` and then `Handlebars.compile`
  turns the name into markup — stored XSS, and with prototype access enabled, a
  template-injection code-execution primitive. Put values in the **data context**
  (`{{name}}`, auto-escaped) or build inputs with the
  `foundry.applications.fields.*` DOM factories.
- **Do not enable `allowProtoMethodsByDefault` / `allowProtoPropertiesByDefault`**
  when the Handlebars context could carry non-plain objects; they disable the
  prototype-access guard.
- **Escape data destined for raw-HTML sinks** (`DialogV2`/`Dialog` content,
  `innerHTML`) with `foundry.utils.escapeHTML`, or render through a template.
  `i18n.localize`/`format` do **not** escape.
- **Do not `{{{triple-mustache}}}` untrusted or data-derived HTML.** If a value
  is assembled from data (e.g. a modifier breakdown), escape at the source or use
  double-mustache.
- **Prefer an allowlist sanitizer** (DOMPurify or
  `foundry.applications.ux.TextEditor.cleanHTML`) over a hand-rolled tag/attribute
  denylist. Denylist sanitizers miss whitespace/entity-obfuscated `javascript:`,
  `data:` URLs, `<base>`, SVG `xlink:href`, surviving `style`, and mXSS.

## Guardrail: cross-client authorization

- **Client-side gating is UX, not authorization.** Removing a button at render
  time (e.g. gating automated-defense buttons by `actor.isOwner`) only changes
  what a cooperating client shows. A malicious client can call the handler
  directly. The **real** authorization boundary is Foundry's document-ownership
  check at _write_ time — a client can only update documents it owns.
- **Chat-card clicks are authorized by the handler document's ownership.** A card
  addresses each button to the actor that should _handle_ it; running the action
  mutates that actor's own state, so authorization is document ownership. The
  dispatch resolves the handler and honors the click **only if `doc.isOwner`**
  (`resolveAuthorizedChatCardHandler`, a GM owns all) — for **intrinsic** actions
  as well as `SCRIPT` — before any dialog, `buildActionScope` revival, or logic
  runs; each `onChatCardButton` also re-checks `this.isOwner` so a direct call is
  refused too. The render-time `gateAutomatedDefenseButtons` is UX only. See the
  [Chat-card dispatch contract — Authorization](../reference/runtime-contracts.md#authorization-the-handler-documents-owner-acts).
- **Actor-state sovereignty.** An actor mutates only itself. Cross-actor effects
  go through a target-addressed chat acknowledge button, resolved on the target's
  own client. See [Architecture](architecture.md) and
  [Extension Points](../how-to/extension-points.md).

## Guardrail: no unbounded regex on data (ReDoS)

A regex driven by attacker-influenced input can hang the client tab.

- **Length caps are not a ReDoS guard.** A short pattern with nested quantifiers
  still backtracks catastrophically.
- **Remove quantifier ambiguity** (do not let a character class overlap the
  separator that starts a repeated group; use atomic/possessive forms).
- For user-influenced patterns, use a non-backtracking matcher, an evaluation
  timeout, or restricted regex features.

## Red-flag checklist (for reviewers and AI agents)

Treat any of these as a blocker until proven safe against the threat model:

- `eval(`, `new Function(`, `Function(`, `AsyncFunction`, or a
  `deserializeFn`-style "compile a string" path. `textToFunction` has exactly
  one sanctioned caller — the GM Expression Library (above); a **new** caller,
  or any `textToFunction` reachable from untrusted/cross-client data, is a
  blocker.
- `Handlebars.compile(` on a string built by interpolating data.
- `.innerHTML =` / `insertAdjacentHTML` / `{{{ }}}` / `new Handlebars.SafeString`
  with a value that could come from data.
- `allowProtoMethodsByDefault` / `allowProtoPropertiesByDefault`.
- A hand-rolled HTML sanitizer (tag/attribute denylist).
- A `data-*` attribute or chat flag passed to `defaultFromJSON` /
  `JSON.parse` + evaluate.
- A document `update`/`delete` in a socket/hook/chat handler with no
  `isOwner`/`canUserModify`/`isGM` check.
- A `RegExp` built from, or matched against, attacker-influenced data without a
  backtracking bound.
- A new string→function or string→predicate path (other than `SafeExpression`,
  or the single sanctioned GM Expression Library caller of `textToFunction`).

## Tracking

- The reference-code remediation is tracked under the "eliminate runtime code
  compilation" epic; the XSS and ReDoS hardening under their respective epics.
  Browse `gh issue list --label security`.
- The class registry: `src/utils/kindRegistry.ts`. The predicate allowlist:
  {@link sohl.entity.expr.SafeExpression}. GM homebrew runs through Foundry `Macro` documents.
