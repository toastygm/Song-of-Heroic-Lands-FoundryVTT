# Shortcode Integrity

See also: [Runtime Contracts](./runtime-contracts.md), [Extension Points](../how-to/extension-points.md), [System Development](../contributing/system-development.md)

`shortcode` is the system's stable lookup key. Together with `type` it addresses a
document — `fvttFindItemByShortcode`, `fvttActorByShortcode`, the action registry
(`actions.get(shortcode)`), cohort members, expression references, and archetype
override/dedup all resolve by it. This page is the contract for how that key is kept
**unique and never-null**.

## Identity semantics

`(type, shortcode)` is a **logical identity**, not merely a lookup convenience:

> Two documents of the same `type` bearing the same `shortcode` denote the **same
> logical entity** — regardless of their Foundry `_id`s and regardless of their field
> values.

The Foundry `_id` identifies a _particular stored document instance_; `(type,
shortcode)` identifies _which thing that instance is_. A compendium `WeaponGear`
`bsw`, a world copy of it, and an embedded copy on an actor are three distinct
instances (three `_id`s, possibly three different states of wear and modification) of
**one** entity, the broadsword. Sameness of `(type, shortcode)` is what "the same
thing" means in this system; `_id` equality and value equality are neither necessary
nor sufficient for it.

This is what makes **matching** well-defined, and matching is the reason the key
exists:

- **Compendium ↔ world reconciliation.** A world document is recognized as _the same
  entity_ as its compendium origin because they share `(type, shortcode)`, even
  though import gave the world copy a fresh `_id` and the user has since edited its
  values.
- **Archetype override / shadowing.** A world archetype with the same `(type,
shortcode)` as a shipped one _shadows_ it in the Create dialog — same identity,
  world copy wins.
- **Cross-scope lookup.** `fvttFindItemByShortcode` / `fvttActorByShortcode`,
  `actions.get(shortcode)`, cohort membership, and expression/effect references all
  resolve an entity by this identity rather than by a brittle, localizable name or a
  scope-local `_id`.

The uniqueness invariant below exists **to keep this identity well-defined**: if two
different entities within one scope shared a `(type, shortcode)`, "the same thing"
would be ambiguous and every match above would be unsound.

## The shape rule

A `shortcode` is **strictly alphanumeric** — `^[A-Za-z0-9]+$`. No hyphens, no
underscores, no spaces, no punctuation, no accented letters. Case is unconstrained
(hundreds of authored codes are mixed-case, e.g. `armorgear:BCap`).

The rule is not cosmetic. A shortcode is half of the `type-shortcode` address that
content wikilinks and knowledgebase pages parse, and that parse depends on the
separating hyphen being the **only** hyphen in the string (see
[Linking Between Content Notes](../content-creator/content-links.md)); the same key also has to survive
URLs, YAML frontmatter, and expression source unescaped.

The pattern is stated **twice, on purpose**, and a test keeps the two equal.
`src/utils/shortcode-format.mjs` (`isValidShortcode` / `sanitizeShortcode`) is the
runtime's copy — plain ESM, so the create/update guards and the world migration
share it. `@heroiclands/package-build` carries the build-time copy, because it
lints every package's content tree and not just this one's. Shipped code cannot
import a build dependency, so neither copy can be removed;
`tests/build/shortcode-format-agreement.test.ts` compares them and is the only
thing that would notice a drift.

Repair, where a violation cannot simply be refused, **spells every letter it can and
drops the rest, keeping case** — `B&CFl` → `BCFl`, `self-pro` → `selfpro`,
`Tabûri` → `Taburi`, `Æthelred` → `AEthelred`. That is deliberately not
`slugifyShortcode`, which also lowercases and abbreviates: that one derives a _new_ key
from a display name, while a repair keeps an _existing_ identity as recognizable as
possible.

Keeping the identity recognizable is why a letter is **folded rather than deleted**.
`sanitizeShortcode` carries the value into ASCII with `toAsciiLetters` — the same fold
`slugifyShortcode` uses — before it drops anything, so an accented letter becomes its
base (`û` → `u`) and a letter with no mark to separate is written out (`Æ` → `AE`,
`þ` → `th`). Deleting instead changes **which entity the key names**: a document
repaired from `Tabûri` to `Tabri` no longer matches the compendium entry it came from,
which the identity semantics above make a silent, irreversible break (issue #1748).
Folding is a no-op on an ASCII key, so the two punctuation repairs are unaffected; what
the fold cannot carry into a letter or digit is still dropped, so `Kûrbúl ¾-Helm`
repairs to `KurbulHelm`.

### The rule binds the system's own keys too

Nothing exempts a key the _system_ writes. The singleton world host
(`sohl.worldHost()`, issue #588) is created through the same create guard as any
document, so its reserved code is subject to the same pattern — and its original
`_sohlworld` was refused as malformed, which vetoed the host's own creation and
left `sohl.worldHost()` returning `undefined` (issue #1536). The code is now
`sohlworld`, which is also what the 0.9.0 repair migration produces from a host a
v0.8 world already created, so an upgraded world keeps the host it has.

Reserved codes are reserved by _convention_, not by a separate namespace: they
are ordinary `(type, shortcode)` keys and share the uniqueness scopes below. Do
not author content that claims one.

## The invariant

`(type, shortcode)` is unique within each of four **scopes**, and `shortcode` is a
non-null, non-blank string on every persisted key-bearing document:

| Scope               | Uniqueness set                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **World items**     | every item in `game.items` of the same `type`                |
| **Embedded items**  | an actor's own items of the same `type`                      |
| **World actors**    | every actor in `game.actors` of the same `type`              |
| **Compendium pack** | a single pack's entries of the same `type` (items or actors) |

Cross-scope duplicates are fine: a world item and an embedded copy, or the same code
in two different packs, do not collide. Two _different_ types may also share a
shortcode (the key is the pair).

## Where both rules are enforced

Enforcement is entirely at runtime and build time — the schema field itself stays
permissive. The base `shortcode` field in `SohlDataModel.ts` is
`StringField({ initial: "" })`, deliberately **blank-tolerant at construction**:
Foundry validates a document _before_ `_preCreate` runs, so a strict `blank: false`
here would reject bare creates before the key could be filled. (No subtype schema
overrides this field — earlier comments claiming otherwise were aspirational.)

### Runtime — create and update

Two shared Foundry-layer guards resolve the scope, apply the key, and veto a
disallowed operation. They are wired into both documents' create **and** update hooks:

- `SohlItemDataModel.ts` `_preCreate` and `SohlItem.ts` `_preUpdate` (items)
- `SohlActor.ts` `_preCreate` and `_preUpdate` (actors)

Each calls the shared helpers in `shortcode-uniqueness.ts`
({@link sohl.core.foundry.enforceShortcodeOnCreate},
{@link sohl.core.foundry.enforceShortcodeOnUpdate}, and the scope resolver
{@link sohl.core.foundry.collectTakenShortcodes}). Historically only _create_ was
guarded and compendium creates were skipped; both gaps are now closed.

A collision and a malformed key are different mistakes with different fixes, so the
veto says which: `SOHL.CreateDocument.duplicateShortcode` for the first,
`SOHL.Shortcode.invalidCharacters` for the second. The Create dialog's live check
disables **Create** for either, so a human never reaches the `_preCreate` reject.

### Build time — packs

Authored compendium content is Markdown under `assets/content/`, seeded into packs by
the compendium CLI, which **bypasses `_preCreate`**. The build-time guard
`lint:addresses` (`content-build lint`, part of `npm run lint`) walks that
content and fails on any shortcode that is not strictly alphanumeric, and on any
duplicate `(type, shortcode)`.

**The rule lives in the toolchain, not here.** Three repositories author notes
against it, so a copy in this repository's `utils/` was a rule the other two did
not have — which is why they were never checked at all
(HeroicLands/content-build#20). The runtime keeps its own plain-ESM copy of the
_shape_ rule in `src/utils/shortcode-format.mjs`, because shipped code cannot
import a build dependency; `tests/build/shortcode-format-agreement.test.ts` is
what keeps the two equal.

**The build-time scope is wider than the per-pack runtime scope above, and
deliberately so.** The guard once claimed per-pack uniqueness, on the reasoning
that a type routed to exactly one pack — which `pack:` frontmatter made false.
What the pipeline actually enforces is that a document is addressed by
`(type, shortcode)` across **every** pack of its document type, so routing two
same-address notes to different packs does not separate them (#1678). Authored
content therefore has to satisfy the stricter rule, even though the runtime
uniqueness table above scopes a compendium to itself.

Content is authored directly under `assets/content/`, so a malformed key is fixed in
the note that carries it. A key that has already shipped also needs a world migration,
since `shortcode` is identity referenced from saved world data.

### Existing worlds — migration

The 0.9.0 migration `alphanumericShortcode` (`MigrationRegistry.ts`) rewrites any
stored shortcode that fails the shape rule, applying the same strip-and-keep-case
repair, so a world that imported a legacy key keeps pointing at the same entity as its
renamed compendium origin. It leaves a blank shortcode alone (filling one in is the
create/update guard's job, and only the guard knows the scope's taken-set) and leaves
a key untouched when neither it nor the document name yields anything alphanumeric —
a random id would sever the identity rather than preserve it.

## The resolver matrix

The pure decision logic is {@link sohl.utils.resolveShortcodeKey} — Foundry-free and
unit-tested. It takes the desired shortcode, the document name, the taken set, and a
`shortcodeDedupe` flag, and returns `{ shortcode }` or `{ reject: true }`:

| shortcode in data          | name → slug | `shortcodeDedupe` | result                                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| provided, alphanumeric     | —           | `true`            | collides → suffix (`arrow` → `arrow2`); else accept |
| provided, alphanumeric     | —           | `false`/absent    | collides → **reject** (`collision`); else accept    |
| provided, not alphanumeric | —           | `true`            | stripped (`B&CFl` → `BCFl`), then as above          |
| provided, not alphanumeric | —           | `false`/absent    | **reject** (`invalid`)                              |
| blank                      | non-empty   | `true`            | base = slug; collides → suffix                      |
| blank                      | non-empty   | `false`/absent    | base = slug; collides → **reject**                  |
| blank                      | blank       | `true`            | random 16-char id                                   |
| blank                      | blank       | `false`/absent    | **reject** (`missing`)                              |

A reject carries a `reason` (`collision` / `invalid` / `missing`) so the veto can say
which mistake was made. Shape is settled before uniqueness: a malformed key cannot be
made valid by suffixing it. Surrounding whitespace is trimmed, not treated as a
breach.

A Foundry native duplicate (`_stats.duplicateSource`) suffixes an explicit collision
— and repairs a malformed code — even without `shortcodeDedupe`; it is copying a key
it did not author. The random-id branch uses an **injected** generator so
the resolver stays Foundry-free; the Foundry layer passes
{@link sohl.core.FoundryHelpers.fvttRandomId} (Foundry's id charset). Deduplication
reuses {@link sohl.utils.uniqueShortcode}; name derivation reuses
{@link sohl.utils.slugifyShortcode}.

> **Behavior note.** `_preCreate` is **strict by default**: a name-derived _or_ explicit
> collision without `shortcodeDedupe` now fails (previously the name-derived case always
> auto-uniquified). Callers that legitimately create colliding siblings must opt in.

## The `shortcodeDedupe` option

Any document opts into automatic key management by passing `shortcodeDedupe: true` to
the create/update operation (`Document.create(data, { shortcodeDedupe: true })`); it
threads to `_preCreate`/`_preUpdate` as `options.shortcodeDedupe`. It is not a Foundry
operation field, so typed call sites cast the options object.

- **Opt in** (auto-manage) — system-generated creation that names no key of its own:
  `fvttCreateEmbeddedItems` (the logic layer's item-creation boundary — inflicted
  trauma, fatigue, …) and cross-actor gear drops in `SohlActorSheetBase.ts`.
- **Stay strict** (reject on collision) — the human Create dialog, which instead
  pre-resolves a unique shortcode and **live-checks** the field, disabling **Create**
  until it is unique (warning key `SOHL.CreateDocument.duplicateShortcode`). See
  [Extension Points §10](../how-to/extension-points.md).

## A shortcode is half of the published URL

**A page's URL is its address**: a content note publishes at
`/<package>/<type>-<shortcode>/` — `/sohl/skill-wpnc/` for Weaponcraft. Notes carry
no authored `slug` (#1278) and no display string reaches the URL;
`contentAddress` in `@heroiclands/package-build/engine/content-address` derives it
from the frontmatter's `type` and `shortcode` alone.

That follows from the invariant above rather than fighting it. `(type, shortcode)`
names one note, so an address is **unique by construction**: the uniqueness rule
this page already states is the URL's guarantee too, and there is no second,
URL-specific collision check. And because the address is
identity rather than presentation, **a rename does not move it**: retitling a note
changes what the page says and nothing about where it lives, so every link into it —
authored, published, or bookmarked — goes on resolving. Nothing needs redirecting,
so nothing records former URLs.

The cost is paid on the other side. A shortcode is referenced from **saved world
data** — actions, cohorts, expressions, archetypes, pack lookups — so changing one is
a data migration rather than a cosmetic edit, and it moves a public URL as well.
Pick it once, and pick it to last.

**A rename also moves the document's Foundry `_id`**, because that too derives
from the address (#1841): `makeId("document", "<package>-<system>-<type>-<shortcode>")`.
This is the one place the derivation costs something an authored id did not —
which is exactly what the `id:` escape hatch is for. Where a document must keep
its identity across a rename, pin the id it already had, with a comment saying
why. Note this changes nothing about _whether_ a rename is breaking: it already
broke every wikilink into the note, so it is a breaking change either way.

No document stores a URL of its own, either. In-app documentation is the compiled
JournalEntry an item points at through `docHtml`'s `@UUID`, which is a Foundry
reference rather than a web address; a per-document absolute URL would make a change
to either one a pack rebuild plus a world migration.

**`slugify` is a different job.** `@heroiclands/package-build/engine/content-slug`
reduces a piece of prose to a URL-safe token for **heading anchors** — where an
author writes the matching key by hand, pinning `locations.stair-foot` at a heading
called _Stair Foot_ — and for **pack filenames**, read back only by the unpacker. It
transliterates before reducing, so an accented character is carried across rather
than dropped: `Nüsvōrroth` reduces to `nusvorroth`, where a stripping slugifier
produced `n-sv-rroth`. Ligatures expand as a reader would spell them (`þ`→`th`,
`æ`→`ae`, `œ`→`oe`, `ß`→`ss`, `ĳ`→`ij`, `ﬁ`→`fi`; eth follows the Icelandic `d`),
apostrophes are removed rather than made separators (`Armorer's Kit` →
`armorers-kit`), and a fraction keeps its digits together (`Kûrbúl ¾-Helm` →
`kurbul-34-helm`, not `kurbul-3-4-helm`).

**There is no alias namespace.** A wikilink is always qualified —
`[[type-shortcode|Text]]`, see
[Linking Between Content Notes](../content-creator/content-links.md) — and a note
authors no top-level `aliases:` field; the build refuses one. The nested
`name.aliases` is kept but **reserved**: no index, resolver, lint rule or emitter
consults it, and a note carrying one compiles, resolves and publishes exactly as if
it were absent.

Developer docs (`kb/dev-docs/`) are not content notes — they have no shortcode and keep
their own `slug` frontmatter, routed by source path.

## Testing

- **Shape rule** — `tests/utils/shortcode-format.test.ts` covers `isValidShortcode`
  and `sanitizeShortcode` (no Foundry).
- **Resolver** — `tests/utils/helpers.test.ts` exercises every matrix cell with an
  injected `makeRandomId` stub (no Foundry).
- **Migration** — `tests/domain/migration/MigrationRegistry.test.ts` covers the
  0.9.0 repair, including the three renamed content keys.
- **Address and slug derivation** — covered by
  [`@heroiclands/package-build`](https://github.com/HeroicLands/package-build)'s own
  suite, against fixtures it owns (no Foundry).
- **Runtime + dialog + pack** — `cypress/e2e/shortcode-uniqueness.cy.js` drives the
  live client: an explicit collision is rejected on create, `shortcodeDedupe` suffixes
  it, renaming into a collision is rejected on update, and the same code on a different
  type is allowed. The build-time guard is `npm run lint:addresses`.
