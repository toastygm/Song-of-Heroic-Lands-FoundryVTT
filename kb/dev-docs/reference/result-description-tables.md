# Result-description tables

A **result-description table** (a `SuccessTestResult.LimitedDescription[]`) maps a
test outcome to a **descriptive label** — the mechanism that lets a test report
"You go screaming down the halls in terror" instead of a bare "Critical Failure".
Every success test resolves its outcome through one of these tables to produce the
`resultText` / `resultDesc` shown on the chat card, plus a numeric star/quality
count.

They are an **extension point**: the system ships a few built-ins, and a table can
be supplied per test so authors can attach meaningful, flavorful descriptions.

## The row shape

Each row of a table is a `LimitedDescription`:

| Field         | Type                       | Meaning                                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `maxValue`    | `number`                   | Upper bound (inclusive) of the test's **target value** this row matches. |
| `lastDigits`  | `number[]`                 | Roll last-digits this row applies to; empty matches any.                 |
| `success`     | `boolean`                  | Whether the row is a success.                                            |
| `label`       | `string \| SafeExpression` | The result label (`resultText`).                                         |
| `description` | `string \| SafeExpression` | The result description (`resultDesc`).                                   |
| `result`      | `number \| SafeExpression` | The numeric result/quality (e.g. star count).                            |

Resolution finds the first row (sorted by `maxValue`) whose `maxValue >= targetValue`
and whose `lastDigits` matches the roll's last digit, then reads its
`label`/`description`/`result`.

## Derived on read, never stored

The display outcome — `resultText`, `resultDesc`, and the numeric `valueDiamonds` —
is **not** stored on a `SuccessTestResult`. Those are getters that resolve the table
against the result's evaluated `successLevel` / `targetValue` / `lastDigit` each time
they are read, so `toJSON` carries only the raw `successLevel` and the table, never
the three derived values. The one place the derived strings are
materialized is `toChat`, which folds them into the chat-card data — rendered once by
the sender (whose `targetValueFunc` is live) and posted as HTML.

This keeps a single source of truth: change the table and the label changes, with no
stale frozen copy to reconcile. It relies on the table itself crossing the wire (see
[Serialization](#serialization)); the raw `successLevel` is the one deliberately
cached derived value, so a re-evaluated result recomputes its stars identically.

## Literal or computed fields

`label`, `description`, and `result` may each be a **literal** or a
{@link sohl.entity.expr.SafeExpression} computed at resolution time. A computed
field is evaluated against these bindings:

- `successLevel` — the test's success level.
- `targetValue` — the resolved target value.
- `lastDigit` — the roll's last digit.

```ts
import { SafeExpression } from "@src/entity/expr/SafeExpression";

// A row whose star count is one more than the (negative) success level.
const row = {
  maxValue: -1,
  lastDigits: [],
  success: false,
  label: "You go screaming down the halls in terror",
  description: "",
  result: new SafeExpression({ source: "successLevel + 1" }, { parent }),
};
```

> **Why `SafeExpression`, not a raw function?** A computed field must be a
> `SafeExpression`, never a JavaScript function. A function is dropped silently by
> `JSON.stringify` (and reviving one is forbidden by the
> [security model](../concepts/security-model.md)), so a table with a raw function
> could not cross to another client — the player watching would see nothing. A
> `SafeExpression` is **data** (a source string evaluated in the sandbox), so the
> whole table serializes and every client renders the same flavor text.
>
> `SafeExpression` today covers numbers, booleans, comparisons, string literals,
> and `+` concatenation — enough for a computed `result`. Richer **string**
> operations for computed `label`/`description` text (`toUpper`, `concat`, `trim`,
> …) are tracked separately.

## Serialization

Because a result crosses between clients (a chat card seen by every player), its
table rides the wire as **pure data**, following the subsystem's
reference-on-wire / live-object-in-memory rule:

- **`toJSON`** reduces each computed field to its serialized form via
  `serializeLimitedDescriptionTable` — a `SafeExpression` becomes its
  `__kind`-tagged source string; literals pass through. (Emitting a live
  `SafeExpression` would recurse into its parent back-reference during the
  `undefined→null` pass — see the helper's note.)
- **The constructor** revives each field via `reviveLimitedDescriptionTable`,
  rehydrating a serialized expression into a live `SafeExpression` owned by the
  result's parent logic.

## Where tables come from

- **Built-ins** — {@link sohl.entity.modifier.MasteryLevelModifier}'s default
  `testDescTable` (the standard success-level table) and `svTable` (the
  success-value table); the skill fate table.
- **Per test** — a {@link sohl.entity.modifier.MasteryLevelModifier} may be built
  with a custom `testDescTable`/`svTable`, or a result with a custom
  `resultDescTable`, to attach a bespoke set of descriptions to that test.

A `resultDescTable` is how a **generic** `successTest()` becomes a bespoke
graded test **without a subclass or a bespoke card** — it is the "outcome
mapping as data" half of the pattern in
[Extension Points §3](../how-to/extension-points.md#adding-a-graded--special-result-test--pass-data-dont-subclass).
The other half — offering a follow-up action from the result — is the `buttons`
input documented next.

## The `toChat` card-data contract

`SuccessTestResult.toChat(data?)` renders the standard test card
(`templates/chat/standard-test-card.hbs`). The card template binds directly to
the result's serialized `toJSON()` payload, so `toChat` **folds several derived,
non-serialized fields into the card data** (they are getters `toJSON` omits, or
live objects `fvttMergeObject`'s deep-copy would strip of their prototype). An
author reading the template — or supplying extra `data` — relies on this
contract:

| Card-data field                               | Source                                                                                                   | Why it must be folded                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resultText` / `resultDesc` / `valueDiamonds` | `resolveDescription()` against the `resultDescTable`                                                     | Derived-on-read, never stored (see [above](#derived-on-read-never-stored))         |
| `mlMod`                                       | the `MasteryLevelModifier`'s `constrainedEffective`, `effective`, `chatHtml`, `empty`, `successLevelMod` | The **Target** (roll-at-or-under value) and the per-delta breakdown — live getters |
| `roll.total`                                  | `SimpleRoll.total`                                                                                       | A getter absent from `SimpleRoll.toJSON`                                           |
| `isSuccess` / `isCritical`                    | the result's outcome getters                                                                             | Drive pass/fail styling and the localized footer                                   |
| `item.uuid` / `actor.uuid`                    | the owning item and its actor                                                                            | The card root, edit-pencil, and Fate button dispatch against these                 |
| `fateScopeJSON`                               | serialized `{ priorTestResult: this }`, only when Fate is offered                                        | Lets a Fate click reconstruct _this_ result (never a re-roll)                      |

> A subclass or a caller that reposts the card must fold the same fields, or the
> Target, Roll, styling, and buttons render blank — the class binds to `toJSON`,
> not the live object.

### Follow-up buttons (`data.buttons`)

`toChat` accepts an optional **`buttons`** entry in `data` — one
{@link sohl.document.chat.ActionCardButton} or an array. It is folded through the
shared `toRenderableButtons` normalizer (the same one the action-card framework
uses), so the standard card can carry arbitrary **follow-up consent buttons**
without a bespoke template:

```ts
await result.toChat({
  buttons: {
    action: "applyShockState",
    handlerUuid: beingUuid,
    scope: { priorTestResult: result },
    label: sohl.i18n.localize("SOHL.Being.ShockTest.apply"),
    iconFAClass: "fa-solid fa-face-dizzy",
  },
});
```

Each rendered button carries the well-known `action-card-button` handles
(`data-action` / `data-handler-uuid` / `data-scope` / `data-skip-dialog`) and
dispatches through the shared chat-card chokepoint. **Nothing auto-fires** — the
button is _offered_ and the target's controlling player accepts (the consent
model). Combined with `resultDescTable`, a graded test is now the outcome
_mapping_ (`resultDescTable`) **plus** the follow-up _actions_ (`buttons`), both
as data — removing the last reason several bespoke result cards existed. The
existing edit-pencil and _Perform Fate Test_ buttons are unaffected.
