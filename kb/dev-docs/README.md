# SoHL Developer & API Documentation

The entry point for working **on** the Song of Heroic Lands (SoHL) system — for developers extending the API, contributors changing core, and anyone who needs a mental model of the code.

This documentation is **developer- and API-facing only**. Player- and GM-facing rules and play guides are not duplicated here — they live on the project site (see [Player & GM rules](#player--gm-rules-external) below).

## Start here

1. [Architecture Overview](concepts/architecture.md) — the system's mental model and a map of the `src/` tree. **Read this first.**
2. [Getting Started](how-to/getting-started.md) — environment setup, codebase tour, and your first change.
3. [API Reference](/sohl/api/) — generated TypeDoc, with a sidebar grouped to mirror the source: Core / Documents / Domain / Utility.

> **Security-critical change?** If you are touching serialization, HTML
> rendering, actions/executors, or chat/cross-client flows, read
> [Security Model & Guardrails](concepts/security-model.md) **first**. Its
> keystone rule — _data carries a **reference** to code (a `__kind` tag, a method
> name, a Macro UUID), never source; functions are never serialized_ — is the
> system's top security constraint.

## Concepts

Design and rationale — how and why the system is built the way it is.

- [Architecture Overview](concepts/architecture.md) — the mental model and a map of the `src/` tree. **Read this first.**
- [The SoHL API](concepts/sohl-api.md)
- [Combat Model](concepts/combat-model.md) — assisted vs. automated combat, and how the combat flow is wired programmatically (combatants, the exchange workflow, resolution).
- [Macros and Actions](concepts/macros-and-actions.md)
- [Action Cards & the Consent Model](concepts/action-cards.md) — the universal pattern every automated interaction is built on: self-sufficient actions offered across the chat log, run only at a human's behest. **Read before adding any cross-client flow.**
- [Expressions and Scripts](concepts/expressions.md) — the ways author-supplied logic runs: `SafeExpression`, Macros, and the Expression Library.
- [Security Model & Guardrails](concepts/security-model.md) — the threat model and the standing rules every change must respect. **Read before touching serialization, HTML rendering, actions, or cross-client flows.**
- [CSS Architecture & Styleguide](concepts/css-architecture.md)

## How-to

Task-oriented guides for getting something done.

- [Getting Started (New Developer Guide)](how-to/getting-started.md)
- [Extension Points](how-to/extension-points.md)
- [API Access Map](how-to/api-access-map.md)
- [Lifecycle Hooks](how-to/lifecycle-hooks.md)
- [House Rules Cookbook](how-to/house-rules-cookbook.md)
- [Writing Guided Tours](how-to/guided-tours.md) — the `SohlTour` framework: step kinds, value/action gates, sheet navigation, and how to register a tour.
- [Testing](how-to/testing.md)
- [Build, Deployment, and Release](how-to/build-and-deployment.md)
- [Issue Reporting](how-to/issue-reporting.md) — how issues are typed, prioritized, labeled, and tied to capability milestones.

## Content Creator

Authoring the content notes in `assets/content/` that compile into compendium documents — for the person writing notes rather than changing the system.

- [Content Creator](content-creator/README.md) — the section landing: what a content note is, and which page answers which question.
- [The Authoring Workflow](content-creator/authoring-workflow.md) — where content lives, the frontmatter every note carries whatever its type, and how a note becomes a compendium document. **Read this first.**
- [Item Note Frontmatter](content-creator/item-frontmatter.md) — the generated per-type field reference for all 13 item types: every `sohl:` field, its shape, requiredness, and default.
- [Actor Notes](content-creator/actor-notes.md) — authoring a `being`, and the `(type, shortcode)` address space its embedded items resolve through.
- [Map Notes](content-creator/map-notes.md) — authoring a Foundry Scene as a markdown note: the `battlemap` / `localmap` / `regionalmap` schema, the two unit conventions, regions and their behaviours, and how a map is packaged.
- [Authoring a Macro Content Note](content-creator/macro-notes.md) — how a `type: macro` note compiles into a Foundry Macro plus its documentation, and what the `{#script}` anchor does.
- [Linking Between Content Notes](content-creator/content-links.md) — wikilinks for content authors: the three forms, and why an item and its documentation need two different addresses.
- [Asset Conventions](content-creator/asset-conventions.md) — where art files live, how `img:` resolves to a shipped path, image and SVG standards, and default item art.
- [Generated Content Tables](content-creator/content-tables.md) — SQL queries that tabulate content notes from their frontmatter.
